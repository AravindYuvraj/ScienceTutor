Cell - Structure and Functions

n the previous class you have already
learnt about cells and their structure. You
have also learnt about discovery of the cell,
its size and shape, unicellular and
multicellular organisms.
Let us recall some of the activities
related to these aspects. For example :
Onion cells are nearly rectangular
while the cheek cells are irregular in shape.
Add other examples as the one given
above.

Primarily, cells are studied under the
microscope. When we observe the cell
under a compound microscope, we can see
some parts like cell wall, cytoplasm,
nucleus, chloroplast and the mitochondria.
However, when the same cells are observed
under the electron microscope, a few other
structures are also visible.
To study various cells scientists have
been trying to observe cells from different
parts of plants and animals, draw their
structures, take photograph of them and
make models of them. These have given

valuable information about plant and animal
cells. Here we will try to study the model
diagram of the cell.

Typical Cell

All the organelles shown in the typical
cell of plant or animal will not exist in every
cell. For example, chloroplasts are always
shown in the typical plant cell, yet all the
plant cells do not have chloroplasts. They
are mostly found in the cells of green
leaves, tender stems etc. The organelles
that feature in most of the cells are included
in this model. The typical cell provides a
way to study cells. Once we arrive at such a
model, we can compare any cell with it.
Observe the given diagrams of typical plant
and animal cells (Fig-1 & 2).
1. What common features do you see
in both the cells?
2. Which cell organelles are found
exclusively in plant cell?
3. Compare the parts of plant and
animal cells, note down the
differences.
Let us study the different parts of plant
and animal cells.

In your earlier classes, you have already
studied that cell membrane is the covering
of the animal cell. In plant cell there is
another layer present over the cell
membrane known as the cell wall. With the
help of the given activity you will be able
to see a cell membrane.

Cell - Structure and Functions

Cell wall
This is a unique feature seen in plant
cells. While the cell membrane acts as the
outer layer in an animal cell, in a plant cell
there is an extra layer (mainly of cellulose)
outside the cell membrane which is known
as the cell wall. This is considered to be
one of the major difference between a plant
and an animal cells.
The cell wall is a tough but flexible
porous layer that lends a definite shape and
gives protection to the cell. Earlier it was
believed to be inactive, but now it is
considered to be one of the most
significant parts of the cell that
continuously exchanges information with
other cells during growth and development.
What are the functions of the cell wall
in plant cells?
It exerts an inward wall pressure to
resist the outward pressure exerted by the
cytoplasm. Hence, the plant cells can
withstand much greater changes of
surrounding medium than the animal cells.

When we put salt solution over the peel
of Rheo leaf, water present inside the Rheo
leaf cells comes out. It results in the
shrinking of the cytoplasm along with cell
membrane. The outer boundary of coloured
area is actually the Cell membrane or
plasma membrane (fig-3(b)) which became
separated from the cell wall.
However, we can observe the structure
of cell membrane only through an electron
microscope. Cell membrane is flexible and
is made up of mainly lipids and proteins.
In animals the cell membrane is the
outermost layer of the cell that separates
cytoplasm from the external environment.
This is also known as the plasma
membrane. The cell membrane defines the
shape and size of the cell, encloses the
cytoplasm and protects it from the external
environment. The internal environment of
the cell is different from that of outside.
Inside a cell, one finds a very specific
composition of various substances which
maintain a balance. The cell membrane
plays a crucial role in maintaining this
balance.
Any substance entering or leaving the cell
can do so only through this membrane. The
uniqueness of this membrane lies in the fact
that it does not allow every substance to pass
through it. The exchange of substances
through the cell membrane takes place very
selectively. Hence it is known as selectively
permeable membrane. This characteristic of
the membrane enables it to control the
exchange of substances between the cell and
its external environment. You will learn more
about the function of cell membrane in the
Chapter “Plasma membrane”.

important
organelles of the cell. This is also known
as the cell’s control room. The nucleus is
the largest and the most distinct of all cell
organelles. Schleiden, who was one of the
proponents of cell theory, thought that new
cells were created from the nucleus and he
called it as cytoblast.
Except a few, almost all eukaryotic
cells have a nucleus. Red blood cells in
mammals and phloem sieve tubes in plants
are examples of cells that do not have a
nucleus. Even these cells do have nuclei in
the beginning, but it is later out of the cells
and destroyed.
The nucleus regulates and controls all
the functions of a cell and determines the
characteristics of the organism. It consists
of all genetic information. The nucleus is
also closely involved in the process of cell
division.

that the functions of the cell actually take
place in these organelles, it began to be
understood that life resided in these
organelles. In particular, the material inside
and outside the nuclear membrane was
differentiated after the discovery of
nucleus. Hence, protoplasm was
differentiated into cytoplasm and
nucleoplasm. The substance present
between nuclear membrane and
plasmamembrane is called cytoplasm. The
fluid inside the nucleusis known as
nucleoplasm.

membrane. This is very similar to the cell
membrane. Almost the entire genetic
material of the cells is found in the nucleus.
On the basis of the presence or absence
of the organised nucleus, cells are
categorized into two types, i.e. Prokaryotic
cell (without organised nucleus) and
Eukaryotic cell (with organised nucleus).
The Cells that do not have a membrane
bound nuclear material are called
prokaryotic cells. Bacterium is a
prokaryotic cell. Cyanobacteria (bluegreen algae) also belong to this category.
The cells that have membrance bound
nuclear material are called Eukaryotic
cells. ex. Plant cells, Animal cells.

SC

When we look at the temporary mounts
of onion peel, we can see a large region of
each cell enclosed by the cell membrane.
This region takes up very little stain. It is
called the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is the
fluid content bounded by the plasma
membrane. It also contains many
specialised cell organelles. Each of these
organelles performs specific function for
the cell.
Cell organelles are enclosed by
membranes. In prokaryotes, besides the
absence of a defined membrane bound
nucleus (or nuclear region), the membranebound cell organelles are also absent.
Except membraneless Ribosomes.

One of the facts that troubled the
scientists for a long time was that, certain
enzymes present in the cell have the ability

within the cytoplasm for the transport of
substances from one part of the cell to
another. This network of membranes is
known as the Endoplasmic Reticulum.
The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) is a
large network of membrane-bound tubes
and tubules. The ER membrane is similar
in structure to the plasmamembrane.
Endoplasmic Reticulum may have some
granule like structure on its surface which
are called ribosomes, Such ER is called
Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER).
Areas/sections of ER that do not have
ribosomes on them are called Smooth
Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER). Rough
Endoplasmic Reticulum is the site of
protein manufacturing. The SER helps in
the manufacture of fat molecules or lipids,
important for cell function. The
manufactured proteins and lipids are then
sent to various places in the cell depending
on need, using the ER. Some of these proteins
and lipids help in building the cell
membrane.
Thus, one function of the ER is to serve
as channels for the transport of materials
(especially proteins) between various
regions of the cytoplasm or between the
cytoplasm and the nucleus. It also functions
as a cytoplasmic framework providing a
surface for some of the biochemical
activities of the cell. In liver cells SER
plays a crucial role in detoxifying many
poisons and drugs.
However Camillo Golgi had observed
this organelle in the year 1898 using a
6

Fig-7 : Golgi Complex

This organelle is also made up of
several membranes. These membranes
create sac-like structures around which
many fluid-filled vesicles abound. The
proteins and other substances produced in
the ribosome reach the golgi body through
these vesicles. Here, these substances are
altered slightly. In one sense, the function
of the golgi bodies is to pack various
substances before they are transported to
other parts of the cell. From here these
substances are either sent towards the cell
membrane or to another organelle, the
lysosome. After reaching the cell
membrane these substances are secreted
from the cell, and sometimes even used to
regenerate or repair the membrane.
The number of golgi bodies varies from
cell to cell. Their number is particularly
large in those cells that secrete hormones
and enzymes.

to destroy almost all the structures in the
cell but didn’t damage it. This puzzle was
solved when lysosomes were discovered as
tiny particles visible in the cytoplasm. It
was found that they contained the
destructive enzymes. These enzymes
normally do not come in contact with the
rest of the cell. The materials that need to
be destroyed are transported to the
lysosomes. Then the lysosomes get them
digested at times, the lysosomes burst and
the enzymes are released to digest the cell.
Hence, lysosomes are also known as the
suicidal bags of the cell.

Fig-8 : L.S. of Mitochondrian

Mitochondria are small, spherical or
cylindrical organelles. Generally a
mitochondrion is 2-8 micron long and
about 0.5 micron wide. It is about 150 times
smaller than the nucleus. There are about
100-150 mitochondria in each cell. When
seen under the compound microscope, the
mitochondria appear as oval or cylindrical
dots in the cell. The diagram of
mitocondria shown in typical cell is
hypothetical. Electron Microscope reveals
their unique internal structure in great
detail.
Information derived from the Electron
Microscope tells us that the mitochondria
are made up of a double-membrane wall.
The inner membrane of the wall protrudes
into the interior in folds and forms
structures called cristae; the space between
cristae is found filled with a substance
known as the matrix.
Mitochondria are responsible for
cellular respiration, a process through
which the cell derives its energy to do work.
Because of this, mitochondria are also
known as the powerhouses of the cell.

Vacuoles maintain turgur pressure within
the cell. They export unwanted substances

Usually when cells are seen under the
microscope, the image appears as flat and
two-dimensional. It seems that all the
organelles in the cell are situated in one
plane.
In reality, cells have length, breadth and
thickness. We can easily see the length and
breadth. Since we cannot see the thickness
of the cells under the microscope, we tend
to think that these are flat objects. However,
there are a few easy ways to observe the
thickness of the cells. The easiest method
is to slightly change the focus while
viewing plant cells on the slide and look at
the cell wall. You’ll find that you are able

The observations so far made it clear
that all living beings are made up of cells
and that each cell has a nucleus. Around
1838-39, two scientists expressed this in
the form of a theory. The scientists were
Matthias Jakob Schleiden (1804-1881) and
Theodor Schwann (1810-1882). Schleiden
was a Botanist while Schwann was a
Zoologist. For the record, it should be
mentioned that quite a few scientists had
recognized by that time that cells were
present in all living organisms and were
expressing it in their own ways. However,
Schleiden and Schwann were the first to
claim that this fact was true for the entire
plant and animal kingdom. In other words,
they took the first bold step of generalizing
from observations and coming up with a
theory which was applicable to all living
organisms. And because of this, the credit
for propounding the cell theory goes to
them. What is noteworthy is that there was
a gap of about 200 years between Robert
Hooke first observing cells and the
formulation of the cell theory.
Schleiden and Schwann together
formulated the cell theory. This theory
however did not explain as to how the new
cells were formed. Rudolf Carl Virchow

could be formed only by the division of the

The fundamental organizational unit of life is the cell.
Cells are enclosed by a plasma membrane composed of lipids and proteins.
Plasma membrane is a selectively permeable membrane.
In plant cells, a cell wall composed of cellulose is located outside the cell
membrane.
In prokaryotes nuclear membrane is absent.
The endoplasmic reticulum functions both as passageway for intra cellular transport
and manufacturing surface.
Lysosomes are membrane bound sacs filled with digestive enzymes.
The Golgi apparatus consists of stacks of membranes bound vesicles that helps in
the storage.
Mitochondria are also known as powerhouse of the cell.
Three types of plastids are present in the cell;chromoplasts,chloroplasts,

previous activity.
- Leave the set up aside for at least four

• Did all the roots grow in a same manner?
• What happened to the roots which had
been cut off ?
• Write down your findings, regarding the
cut roots and those that were not?
We observe that by removing the tip of
the onion root, having a particular
arrangement of cells, the growth of the root
in length is stopped.
You have observed that cells are present
in groups. Cells in groups which are nearly
similar in structure perform similar
functions. Such groups of cells are called
tissues.
Plant Tissues

One day Haritha went to a park with
Latha. There she saw a gardener cutting
the tips of the plants with a cutter. She had
a doubt and asked the gardener to clear it.

2. Tissues that form outer coverings are
called as Dermal tissues.
3. Tissues that form the bulk of the plant
body, helping in packing other tissues
are called as Ground tissues.
4. Tissues that help in transport of
materials are called as Vascular tissues.
You have already observed some types
of tissues. To observe various types of plant
tissues we need to know some techniques
for preparing slides and cutting sections.
(See annexure for the same).

functions in a plant body.

Types of plant tissues.

There are four basic types of tissues in
the plants. They are :
1. Tissues that bring about overall growth
and repair are called Meristematic
tissues.

From the above figure you can infer that
meristematic tissues are present on the tip,
sides and in between layers of other
tissues. Meristematic tissues at the
growing tip that bring about growth in
length are called as apical meristematic
tissues.
Tissues present around the edges in a
lateral manner and giving rise to growth in
the girth of stem are called lateral
meristematic tissues (also called
Cambium).

Activity-6

Areas from which branching takes place
or a leaf or a flower stalk grows, we find
a kind of meristematic tissue called

From all this we can conclude that
different types of meristematic tissues are
present both in the root tip and shoot tip.
Cells in the meristematic tissues are
- Small and have thin cell wall.
- Living with prominent nucleus and
abundant cytoplasm.
- Compactly arranged without
intercellular spaces.
- Continuously dividing cells.
Let us learn about the other types of
tissues.

meristematic tissues. The other major
groups that we shall study now are dermal
tissue, ground tissue and vascular tissue.

2. Dermal Tissue

• What kind of arrangements do you
observe in the outer layer of the TS of
stem?
We can find the dermal tissue over the
entire surface of the plant body.
We will do the following activity to
observe the dermal tissue more closely.

Activity-8

This activity shows a part of the dermal
tissue of the plants.

Rheo leaf - Dermal tissue.

SC

- Take a fresh leaf of Rheo or Betel plant
- Tear it in a single stroke, so that a thin
whitish edge can be seen at the torn
end.

Dermal tissue usually consists of a
single layer of cells showing variations in
the types of cells on the basis of their
functions and location. These tissues are
divided into three different types. They are
epidermis (outer most layer), stomatal
gaurd cells and epidermal hairs.
The walls of the cells of dermal tissue
are comparatively thicker than the cells of
meristematic tissues. In desert plants it may
be even more thick and waxy. Small pores
are seen in the epidermis of the leaf, called
stomata. They are enclosed by two kidney
shaped cells, called guard cells. Cells of
the roots have long-hair like parts, called
root hair.

Plants have the ability to store certain
substances that are either their excretory
products or accumulated food or some
secretory substances in different ways.
Gum is secreted from the dermal layer
of gum tree.

Stomata and root hair are also dermal
tissues that are essential for gaseous
exchange, transpiration as well as
absorption of water and minerals.
Photosynthesis is also carried out by
certain cells of this tissue.

Have you ever seen a sticky substance
on the trunk or branches of trees like
Acacia, Neem, etc,. What is it? Where is
the gum secreted from?

SC
ER
T

The dermal tissue protects the plants
from loss of water, mechanical damage like
breaking and splitting of branches and
invasion by parasitic and disease causing
organisms. In big trees the dermal tissue
forms several layers above the epidermis.
It is called bark.

Parenchyma

The cells of the ground tissue forms the
bulk of the plant body. It is useful for
storing food and providing physical
support to the plant body. There are mainly
three types of ground tissues. They are
parenchyma,
collenchyma
and
sclerenchyma.

Collenchyma
Fig-9 : Ground tissue- Types

The cells of the parenchyma are soft,
thin walled and loosely packed. The
Parenchyma which contains chloroplasts is
called “Chlorenchyma”. The Parenchyma
which contains large air cavities or spaces
is called “Aerenchyma”. The Parenchyma
which stores water or food or waste
products is called “Storage Parenchyma”.
Collenchyma tissues are thick walled and
longer in size when compared with

You can observe that cells appear larger
with a nucleus that appears prominent

parenchyma. Collenchyma cells are living
and provide structural support.
In the sclerenchyma, the cells are thick
walled and tightly packed without spaces.
So when compared with dermal tissue, the
ground tissue is of various types. And some
of the ground tissues help in
photosynthesis.
Let us observe the ground tissue of some
other stems.

Nehemiah Grew (1641-1712) was a practicing
physician and worked as the secretary of the Royal
Society, London. He began his work on the study of
internal structure of the plants in the year 1664.
Grew’s fundamental inference was “Every plant organ
consists of two types of organical parts. One is pithy
and other is ligneous part”.

SC
ER
T

Grew gave the term “parenchyma” for the pithy part.
Grew initiated the study of tissues (Histology) in plant
bodies and published his work as the book ‘Anatomy of
Plants’ in the year 1682.

4.Vascular Tissue

We know that roots can absorb water
from the soil and send it to other parts of
the plant. The leaves and other green parts
prepare food and supply it to all the parts
of the plant.
Let us study the tissues involved in
transportation.
We have done an experiment on
transportation in class VII, in the chapter
on plant nutrition. We have observed that

(1641-1712)

when a plant is kept in red coloured water,
Some of the parts of the plant turned red.
Do the same experiment again by keeping
a small plant (with roots) in red coloured
water. Leave it for two hours. Now cut a
T.S. of the stem and observe it under the
microscope.
• Which part of the plant is responsible
for this transport?
• Draw a rough sketch of that part and
mark the part that appears red.
19

• What do you conclude from your observations?
The tissues involved in transportation are vascular tissues. They are composed of different
types of cells which show specific arrangements.

tissues as in plants? To study about the
animal tissue we can take examples of
tissues present in some animals that we see

about blood.
There is a red stream that flows in
closed canals in our body. Think what is it?
The red stream that flows in closed
vessels in our body is blood. It is also a type
of connective tissue. Blood explains many
things about us. Blood is the source to
identify our wellness or illness. It is very
interesting to know about the blood current
in our body. There is highly sophisticated
and well developed mechanism to circulate
the blood to the entire body. Our heart pumps
nearly 36 thousand litres of blood to a
distance of nearly 20 thousand kilometers
in the time period of 24 hours. Blood is red
in colour. Do you agree with the statement
that all animals carrying red blood are your
blood relatives? The blood is always not red
in all animals. The cockroach has white
blood where as there is blue coloured blood
in snail. It is really a wonder that blood
appears in different colours.
Normal adult human beings have about
5 litres of blood. A chief component in
blood is water, which is present in the
plasma.
Besides water, it also has several
nutrients such as glucose, amino acids,
proteins, vitamins, hormones, required for
the body and also excretory products such
as lactic acid, urea, salts etc. Plasma also
contains factors responsible for blood
clotting; but heparin helps to prevent blood
clotting in blood vessels.
Cells present in blood are corpuscles.
They are three types 1. RBC, 2. WBC,
3. Blood platelets.

Red Blood Cells also known as
erythrocytes which are red in colour. They
have red coloured protein called
haemoglobin. Because of haemoglobin
blood is red in colour, which helps in the
transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide one
ml of human blood has about 5 millions of
red blood cells which live for 120 days in
blood.
Taking blood of an adult we can make a
chain of red blood cells around the earth at
equator with 7 circles. When you are in
your mother’s womb your RBC are formed
in the liver and spleen. After your birth
these RBC are generated from the bone
marrow of long bones. In mammals, mature
red blood cells are without nucleus.
The second type of cells present in
blood are white blood cells. These cells do
not have haemoglobin, hence they are
colourless and called ‘leucocytes’. These
cells are less in number when compared to
the RBC. They are of two types granulocytes and agranulocytes.
There are three types of cells in the
granulocytes - Neutrophils, Basophils and
Eosinophils. These cells attack and destroy
the microorganisms that enter the blood.
Some white blood cells sacrifice their
life to fight against external enemy (micro
organisms). These dead WBC come out of
wound as pus. Neutrophils are the first line
of defence against bacteria. So they are
called microscopic policemen.
There are two types of agranulocytes
lymphocytes and monocytes. Lymphocytes
secrete antibodies to guard against foreign
material that enter into blood. Monocytes
move like amoeba and attack the foreign

materials and engulf them. The foreign
materials are destroyed inside these cells.
They are called as ‘scavengers’.
Blood platelets are a separate group of
cells which do not have a nucleus. They are
disc like projections. Whenever a blood
vessel is injured, platelets accumulate at the
site of injury and help in the formation of a
blood clot. The clot seals the wound in blood
vessels and prevents further blood loss.
“Your sisters and brothers are not your
relatives”. This shocks you. But it is true,
if you take into consideration the blood
groups. Because, they may not have the
same blood group as yours. Land Steiner, a
German doctor, found a new blood relation
among us. He divided human beings into
four major groups. They are A, B, AB and
O. The person who lives on another side
of the globe is same with your blood group
is also a blood relative. Do you agree this?
AB group human beings can receive the
blood from any other groups. Hence they
are called “Universal Recipients”. ‘O’ group
people can donate the blood to any other
group. So these people are known as
“Universal donors”.

How do muscles contract and relax?
Muscular tissue consists of elongated
cells called muscle fibres. This tissue is
responsible for movement in our body.
Muscles contain special protein called
contractile proteins which contract and
relax to cause movement.
During winter, body shivers. Why?
When the body is exposed to cold air,
we shiver. During shivering muscles
contract and relax producing large amount
of heat. This keeps the body hot.
Based on their structure, location and
function, muscles are of three types. They
are striated muscle, non-striated muscle,
cardiac muscle.
We can move some muscles by our
conscious effort. For example the muscle
present in inner limbs move according to
our wish and will such muscles are called
voluntary muscles. These muscles also
called as skeletal muscles as they are
mostly attached to bones and help in body
movement; these muscles show alternate
light and dark bands or striations. As a result,
they are also called striated muscle. The
cells of this tissue are long, cylindrical, un
branched and have many nuclei in the
cytoplasm (multi nucleated).

If you are wounded deeply, a deep scar
would form at the place of wound? If we
are wounded on skin, a lighter scar would
form. Why? For the reason, that the skin
cells have regenerating character. Think
about the muscle cell. Will they get
regenerated like epithelial cells?
Muscles are responsible for the
movements of hands and legs and also of
several internal organs such as intestine and
heart. Small amounts of muscle tissues also
present in blood vessels. These help in
increasing or decreasing the diameter of
the blood vessel and thus the blood flows.
Heart is made of only one type muscle cells
and they help in pumping the blood.

The movement of food in alimentary
canal and the contraction and relaxation of
blood vessels are involuntary. We cannot
really start them or stop them simply by
wanting to do so. Smooth muscle or
involuntary muscles control such movements. They are also found in the Iris of
the eye, in uterus and in the bronchi of the
lungs. The cells are long with pointed ends
and having a single nucleus (uni nucleated).
They are also called non-striated muscle.
Can you tell why are they called as
non-striated muscle?
The muscles present in the heart are
responsible for pumping of blood. The cells
are long branched and have nuclei. Cells are
joined to each other at their ends. All the
muscle cells in cardiac muscle have
striations. Though it resembles the striated
in its structure, it is an involuntary muscle.
Presence of intercalated disks is the
characteristic feature of cardiac muscle.

Nervous Tissue

water, how do you feel?
Free distribution by T.S. Government 2020-21

How would you know the water is hot
or cold? If you put your leg on a sharp
edged stone while walking, how will
you feel?
The feelings like the above situations
is because of specialized mechanism in our
body. It works like electric current passing
through wires. Brain, spinal cord and nerves
play active role in this mechanism.

Activity-6

Take a slide of nerve cells from the
slide box. Observe it under microscope.
Write your findings
Nerve cells or neurons are the only
cells in the body which do not have the
ability of regeneration. These are very
specialized cells. No two neurons in the
nervous system have same appearance.
Cells of nervous system are highly
specialized for transmitting the stimulus
rapidly from one place to another within
the body. We can identify 3 distinct parts
in nerve cells. They are 1. Cell body or

What we have learnt?

Tissue is a group of cells similar in structure and functions.
Animal tissues can be epithelial, connective, muscular and nervous tissue.
Depending on shape and function, epithelial tissue is classified as squamous,
cuboidal, columnar, ciliated and glandular.
The blood consists of plasma of RBC, WBC and Platelets.
The different types of connective tissues in our body include areolar tissue, adipose
tissue, bone, tendon, ligament, cartilage and blood.
Striated, unstriated and cardiac are three types of muscle tissues.
Nervous tissue is made of neurons that receive and conduct impulses.

substances are required by the cell. They
are solids like glucose, liquids like water,
and gases like oxygen. To understand the
entry or exit of substances through the cell,
let us do the following activities.
For doing these activities, we have to
prepare different solutions.
Preparing Solutions:
To prepare sugar solution we need sugar
and water. In a sugar solution sugar is the
solute and water is the solvent. Sugar
dissolves in water forming sugar solution.
Preparation of saturated solution :
Take 100 ml of cold water in a
beaker. Add sugar/salt. Stir till it is
dissolved. Repeat it till a little amount of
it is left at the bottom of the beaker which
will not dissolve. This is the saturated
solution of sugar/salt.
Which one is more concentrated
solution?:
Take three beakers with hundred ml. of
water in each. Add half teaspoon of sugar
to the first beaker, one teaspoon to the
second and one and a half teaspoon to the
third beaker. Compare the three solutions
and answer the following question.
• The solution of which beaker will be
most sugary? What is the reason?
• Can we convert the solution of beaker
I into solution of beaker III? How?
• How can we make the solution of the
third beaker indicated to that of the
first?
• How much water should we add to the
solution in the third beaker to make it
similar to solution of the first beaker?

Aim : Observation of material in different
solutions

Procedure: Take 100 ml of water in a
beaker. Keep dry raisin (kishmish) in it.

Leave it for one hour. Observe what has
happened. Take it out and compare it with
the dry raisin. Is there any change in the
size of raisin? (You may try the same

Pour water in the petridish to half of
the height of the potato cup. Ensure that
the potato cup does not float or submerge
in water.
Leave the arrangement for half an hour
and note your observations.
Repeat the above experiment by taking
sugar solution in the petridish and water in
the potato cup. Note your observation and
compare with that of your previous one.
By comparing potato and raisin
activities, do you find anything common
among them? What is it?
From your observations you can
conclude that water always moves toward
the sugar solution. What might be the
reason?
The movement of water from less
solute concertration to more solute
concertration across a membrane is called
Osmosis (In Greek, Osmos means
pushing).

With the understanding of above
activities let us try to understand the nature
of the plasma membrane.
a) It allows water to pass through it.
b) It allows certain materials dissolved in
water to pass through.
c) It will not allow certain materials to
pass through it.
Allowing materials to pass through is

In the previous activities we have
observed the movement of water and
materials in plants.

To know more details about plasma
membrane or cell membrane, let us go
through the following paragraphs.

Flow of Information: Helps for flow of
information amongst different cells of the
organism.

The outermost, extremely delicate,
elastic and membranous covering of the
cell that separates its contents from the
external environment is called plasma
membrane. Plasma membrane is
selectively permeable because it allows
entry of certain substances, exit of some
substances while preventing passage to
remaining substances. Plasma membrane is
a living flexible membrane.

Osmosis : It occurs due to presence of tiny
water channels in the plasma membrane.

Cell Continuity: At places plasma
membranes of adjacent cells become
continuous to form plasmodesmata and cell
junctions.

Functions of plasma membrane

Shape : It provides a definite shape to semi
fluid contents of the cell.

Mechanical Barrier : It functions as a
mechanical barrier that protects the internal
contents of the cell.

SC
ER
T

Selective Permeability : The membrane
determines, which substances are to be
allowed to enter or exit from the cell.
Endocytosis : The flexibility of the
membrane enables the cell to engulf food
and other substances (foreign particles)
from its external environment by
endocytosis. Amoeba acquires its food by
this process.

Recognition : It has substances over its
surface which function as recognition
centres and points of attachment. They help
in tissue formation, distinction of foreign
substances and defence against microbes.
42

Specialization: Plasma membrane gets
modified to perform different functions,
e.g. absorption in microvilli.

Transport across the plasma
membrane
The plasma membrane acts as a
physical barrier between the organelles of
a cell and the cytoplasm and between the
cell and its surrounding environment. The
membrane is said to be:
a) Impermeable if the substances do
not pass through the membrane.

b) Permeable if the substances, both
solute (substance which is
dissolved) and solvent (medium in
which solute dissolves) can pass
readily through the membrane.

c) Semipermeable if the membrane
is permeable to solvent but
prevents the passage of solutes.
d) Selectively permeable if the
membrane allows the passage of
solvent and some selected solutes.
* Plasma membrane is selectively permeable.

There are other ways in which materials
move in a medium. Let us study one such
process by the following activity.

corner of a room, what will happen?
How do we feel? Its smell spreads in
the entire room. Let us think of the

Do you know?

Three fourth of the earth is covered
with oceans. Though plenty of water is
there, we cannot use it, since it is salty.
If we remove salts from it we can use it.
When heavy pressure is applied on salt
solution, which is separated from fresh
water with semi permeable membrane,
the water moves from salt solution into
fresh water leaving the salt behind. This
process is known as 'reverse osmosis'.
Nowadays domestically used reverse
osmosis machines are available in the
market, which filters salt water through
three to five membranes.

So far we have studied about osmosis
and diffusion. There are other processes
that occur across the cell membrane about
which we shall study in higher classes.

Do you know?

Thomas Graham, Scottish physical chemist, worked on
diffusion of gases. Graham measured the rate of diffusion of
gases and also studied about diffusion of substances in solutions.
He had inferred that a more soluble substance in a medium
diffuse faster than a less soluble substance. This popularly known
as ‘Graham’s law of diffusion.

What differences could you find

Why do you think such differences
are present in nature?
So far we have done some activities to
study, appreciate and group living
organisms on the basis of the diversity and
variations present in nature. Several
exercises have been done to select
characters to group organisms on the basis
of similarities and differences between
them. The presence of differences between
organisms of the same species is called
variation.
Free distribution by T.S. Government 2020-21

Variations between different species
are always greater than the variation within
a species. As we have observed so far,
variation forms a basis for selection of
characters to group the organisms.
Grouping of organisms on the basis of
certain characters which vary over
populations indicating some common
lineage of each varied group , or the way in
which the organism may have evolved is
classification. Thus classification in
biology is the systematic study of
organisms present in nature with respect
to their evolution.

acquiring change. Most life forms that we
see today had variations that accumulated
over years to allow the organism possessing
them to survive better. Charles Darwin first
wrote about this in his book, “The Origin
of Species” in 1859. When we connect the
idea of evolution to classification we find
in some groups of organisms, the body
designs have not changed over the years
while several organisms have acquired body
designs relatively
recently.
Since
complexity of design
has increased over the
years and is yet to

that older organisms

Classification and evolution

All living things are identified and
categorized on the basis of their structure
and function. Some characteristics are
likely to make more wide-ranging changes
in the body design than others. There is a
role of time in this as well. So, once a
certain body design comes into existence,
it will shape the effects of all other
subsequent design changes, simply because
it already exists. In other words,
characteristics that came into existence
earlier are likely to be more basic than
characteristics that have come into
existence later.
This means that the classification of
life forms are closely related to their
evolution. Evolution is the process of

History of classification

In India, classification had been the
basis of studies in medicines and dates back
to first and second century A.D. Charaka
and Sushruta had classified the plants on
the basis of their medical importance. There
after Parasara in his book ‘Vrikshyurveda’
(The science of life of trees) documented
the classification system for several land
plants for the first time. This classification
mainly deals with the structure of the
flowers.
Let us study how biologists from 16th
century have been trying to classify diverse
organisms so far.

Although biologists in the 16th and 17th
centuries did not recognize that the
similarities and differences among
organisms were consequences of
evolutionary mechanisms, they still sought
a means to organize biological diversity. In
1758 Carolus Linnaeus proposed a system
that has dominated classification for
centuries. Linnaeus gave each organism two
names, denoting genus and species such as
Homo sapiens (the former representing
genus while the later representing species).
He then grouped genera (several genus)
into families, families into orders, orders
into classes, classes into phyla, and phyla
into kingdoms. Linnaeus identified two
kingdoms: Animalia (animals) and Plantae
(plants). All the terms like species, genus,
Free distribution by T.S. Government 2020-21

family, order, class,
phyla etc. were
defined by Linneaus
on the basis of the
similarities and
differences studied
by him in groups of
organisms.
The first major
Carolus Linnaeus
break from the
Linnaean classification came from Thomas
Whittaker. In 1969 Whittaker proposed a
"five kingdom" system in which three
kingdoms were added to the animals and
plants: Monera (bacteria), Protista, and
Fungi. Whittaker defined the kingdoms by
a number of special characteristics. First,
he specified whether the organisms

places where the temperatures were near
or even above the boiling point of water
(the thermophiles). Others, the extreme
halophiles, were able to tolerate very high
salt concentrations. Other techniques like
DNA (the chemical of design of life)
sequence data also increasingly suggested
that these prokaryotes were most unlike
the traditional bacteria. Thus other
modifications in the classification scheme
came into existence.

possessed a true nucleus (eukaryotic) or
not (prokaryotic). The eukaryotic
unicellular organisms were placed into the
kingdom 'Protista'. The rest were three
multicellular eukaryotic kingdoms that
distinguish themselves by the general
manner in which they acquire food. Plants
are generally autotrophs and use
photosynthetic systems to capture energy
from sunlight. Animals are heterotrophs
and acquire nutrients by ingesting plants or
other animals, and then digesting those
materials. Fungi are also heterotrophs but,
unlike animals, they generally break down
large organic molecules in their
environment and live on them.
The five kingdom system was certainly
an advanced one over the previous system
because it captured the diversity of life in
a better way. Three groups of organisms i.e,
Monera, fungi, and protista - did not fit well
into either the animal or plant category.
Moreover, each of these three groups
appeared to possess diversity comparable
to that of animals or plants. Thus, the
designation of each as a kingdom seemed
fitting.
In the years since Whittaker's system
was developed, however, new evidence and
new methods have shown that the fivekingdom system also fails to adequately
capture what we now know about the
diversity of life. Microbial biologists
became aware of these limitations as they
discovered unicellular organisms that
appeared to be prokaryotic, but were
extremely distinct in their internal
structure and other characteristics from the
traditional bacteria. Some of these unusual
prokaryotes lived in hot springs and other
58

Do you know?

There are various hypothesis as to
the origin of prokaryotic and eukaryotic
cells. Because all cells are similar in
nature, it is generally thought that all
cells came from a common ancestor cell
termed the Last Universal Common
Ancestor (LUCA). These LUCA
eventually evolved into three different
cell types, each representing a domain.
The three domains are the Archaea, the
Bacteria, and the Eukarya (a classification
as suggested by Woese).
Archaea and bacteria are prokaryotic
cells that is they do not have a membrane
bound nucleus, the nuclear material is
dispersed in cytoplasm.
The cell walls of bacteria unlike the
archaea contain a fat like chemical
peptidoglycan..
Eukarya have eukaryotic cells or
cells having a membrane bound nucleus.

Name some plants that produce
seeds.
Which part of the plant produces
seeds? Where is it located?(recall
structure of plant parts studied in
earlier classes)
Do all plants have a definite
structure to produce seeds?
Plants are diverse in nature. The basis
of classifying them is the way they acquire
their food, the type of reproductive
structures they have and the way they
reproduce. They are multicellular,
eukaryotic with cell walls. They are usually
autotrophs and use mainly chlorophyll for
photosynthesis.
The first level of classification among
plants depends on whether the plant body
has well differentiated, distinct parts.
The next level of classification is based
on whether the differentiated plant body has
special tissues (vascular tissues) for the
transport of water and other substances
within it. Further classification looks at the
ability to bear seeds and whether the seeds
are enclosed within fruits.
Let's look at some plants like mosses
and ferns more closely.

lens or under a dissection microscope. You
may find structures like that shown in the
Fig-6.
These are not exactly flowers but
structures that contain seed like structures
called spores. Spores contain very little
food while the seed stores a lot of it.
Moreover where seeds are produced from
ovule of flower, spores are produced within
structures called as sporangium in a
different manner.

The body is bilaterally

the body have the
same design. There
are three layers of cells from which
differentiated tissues can be made, that is
why such animals are called triploblastic.
This allows outside and inside body linings
as well as some organs to be made. There
is thus some degree of tissue formation.
However, there is no true internal body
cavity or coelom, in which well developed
organs can be accommodated. The body is
flattened dorsoventrally, from top to
bottom, that is why these animals are called
flatworms. They are either free living or
parasitic. Some examples of free living

system that helps in circulating water
throughout the body to bring in food and
oxygen. Outer cells are covered with
spicules that act as skeleton. The body design
involves very minimal differentiation and
division into tissues. They are commonly
called 'Sponges' and are mainly found in
marine habitats. Some examples are

These animals are bilaterally

feature of body design, namely a
notochord, at least at some stages during
their lives. The notochord is a long rod-like
supporting structure (chord=string) that
runs along the back of the animal separating
the nervous tissue from the gut. It provides
a place for muscles to attach for ease of
movement. Protochordates may not have a
proper notochord present at all stages in
their lives or for the entire length of the
animal.
Protochordates are marine animals.

are warm-blooded animals. They
maintain their body temperature constant
without changing it according to changes
in the temperature of their surroundings.

Some biologists divide phylum
chordata into three subphyla viz.,

What we have learnt?

SC

Diversity is the hallmark of nature. Variation among the organisms leads to
evolution and growth of diversity.
Scientists started classification of organisms depending upon the similarities and
differences in them (sample under study).
Differences that are observed in very closely related populations are called
variation.
In nature no two organisms are identical.
Classification helps us in exploring the diversity of life forms.
Classification is the systematic study of organisms present in nature.
Classification of life forms is closely related to their evolution.
The major characteristics considered for classifying all organisms into five major
kingdoms are:
i. Whether they are made up of
prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells.
ii. Whether the cells live solitarily or in colonies.
iii.Whether the cells have a cell wall and whether they prepare their own food.
According to Whittaker, all living organisms are divided into five kingdoms, namely:
1. Monera
2. Protista 3. Fungi
4. Plantae
5. Animalia
Plantae and animalia are further divided into subdivisions on the basis of increasing
complexity of body design of organisms.

Naming of organisms with a distinct scientific name is called Nomenclature.
Nomenclature provides a uniform way of identification of the vast diversity of life
around us.
Carolus Linnaeus introduced Binomial nomenclature by which an organism is named
by two words- a generic name and a specific name.

e enjoy the beauty of nature
with our eyes, the melodious
music with our ears, the fragrance of flowers
with our nose, the taste of food with our
tongue and feel the cool breeze with our skin.
What do we do when suddenly bright light
falls on our eyes or a hot utensil is touched
by chance? All these situations show just
how our senses pick up information and react
to them.
Our senses aren't just a part of us, they
define us. This is because nothing that we
experience in our life, from the most
important to the most boring, would be
possible without the intricate power of our
senses.
Nothing in the entire universe of
scientific exploration can even come close
to matching the ability of our brain to use
information sensed by our eyes, ears, skin,
tongue, and nose to produce a rich sensory
experience in a matter of milliseconds!
z But how much do we know about our
senses?

What do our senses do?
Our senses have several roles to play.
They aid our survival by directing us towards
Free distribution by T.S. Government 2020-21

certain informations of our environment
that are important for us and influence some
activity (called as stimuli). For example
tasty food draw us towards them and our
mouth starts watering. Our senses also help
us to locate mates, seek shelter, and
recognize our friends. Incidentally, our
senses also give us the opportunity to find
pleasure in music, art, athletics, etc.
There are yet other things that our
senses do. You may have experienced
feeling hurt to see someone in pain.
Usually when we have strong emotional
bonds with someone and when he or she
experiences pain, so do we( not just
emotional ties, we could be influenced by
situations not directly related to us and yet
feel the pain e.g. sympathizing and feeling
pain of drought affected people).
How do our senses accomplish all this?
The complete answer is complex, but it
involves one elegantly simple idea that
applies across the sensory system. Our
sensory impressions of the world involve
nerve signals. These play a very important
role in the way we react or respond to
various stimuli or even to same stimuli in
different situations.
For example, flavour preference by our
brain is usually based on our body needs,

Stimuli from the environment around
are received by our body through sense
organs. As we already know, they are the
eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. Let's try
to understand the path of receiving a
stimulus and expressing a response
(sensation).

For example, when a mosquito bites
you on your leg the sensation is carried to
the brain through sensory nerves. The brain
sends the message to the hand to kill the
mosquito through motor nerves. Then we
kill it.

Stimulation to Sensation

SC
ER
T

There are certain conditions,
substances etc in nature that trigger the
process of sensing them by our body. These
are stimulants. Information carried by these
stimulants are picked up by certain organs
called as receptors present in our sense
organs and converted into nerve signals.
These are carried to the brain and processed
to create a sensation. For example, when
reflected light (stimulus) from the surface
of a green leaf and its surroundings reaches
receptors in our eyes, it is converted into
nerve signals. These signals reach the brain
and are interpreted as green coloured shape
against a background. We see this as the
leaf.
Brain is the centre for all the sensory
activities. It receives information through
sensory nerves that bring nerve signals
from the sense organs and after
interpretation sends off signals through
another type of nerves called as motor
nerves to parts that respond.

Looking back in History

SC
ER
T

Scientists from ancient times have wondered about the senses. Nearly 2300 years
back Plato and then Aristotle mentioned the five senses of humans among which the
sense of touch was considered the most important. In ancient Indian and Chinese medical
documents also, mention of senses have been found. Thereafter for over a thousand years
no documents regarding the role of senses had been found till Albertus Magnus’
contributions (around 1220 AD).
Albertus Magnus was a bishop in a church in Italy, a keen observer of nature and a
lover of science who followed Aristotelian ideas, but commented on them for the first
time making them accessible for wider academic debate. He mentioned the role of nerves
for the first time in the sensation of touch.
Physiology of sensation has been studied in great detail only from the 17th century
as this was the prime time when several instruments were being invented to aid the unaided
eye to observe more closely. Johannes Kepler (1600 AD), well known for his contributions
to astronomy regarding the rotation and revolution of earth,
established the role of eye as a sense organ.
In recent years, scientists have uncovered new insights into
how our senses work and all the amazing complex and fascinating
things they can do, whether we are aware of them or not. The
electrochemical basis of transmission of nerve signals and
functions of specific areas in the brain involved in sensations
are also better understood.
The number of senses from Aristotelian era to the
nineteenth century stands at five, while in the modern era this
number signifies the sense organs in our body.
Though it is classically considered that humans have five
sense organs, but in fact, we may have many more senses.
We have one sense of touch dedicated to pressure, another
for heat and cold, and yet another for vibration and texture
and that's just one of our traditional sense of touch!

Structure of the Eye

SC

Our eye contains eye lids, eye lashes,
eyebrows and lacrimal glands. A thin layer,
called conjunctiva covers the front portion
of the eye. The eye ball is located in the
eye socket. Only 1/6 portion of the eye ball
is visible to us.
Eye has three main layers. They are
sclerotic layer or sclera, choroid layer and
retina. The outer most thick, tough, fibrous,
non-elastic and white coloured layer is
sclera. The sclera bulges and forms cornea.
The end of sclera connects to the optic
nerve. The second layer is choroid layer.
This layer is black in colour and contains a
lot of blood vessels. It encloses the eye
except the part pupil. The part formed by
the choroid layer around the pupil is iris.
Radial and circular muscles are present in
the iris. Biconvex Lens is present
immediately behind the pupil which is
attached to the ciliary muscles and
suspensory ligaments.
The lens divides the inner eye ball as
aqueous chamber and Vitreous chamber.

Functioning of the Eye:

The Visual Sensation
You might think of the eye as a sort of
“video camera” that the brain uses to make
motion pictures of the world. Like a
camera, the eye gathers light through a
convex lens, focuses it, and forms an image
in the retina at the back of the eye. The lens,
turns the image left to right and upside down
(you may have studied in the chapter on light
that we get an inverted /upside down image
through a convex lens). This visual reversal
may have influenced the very structure of
the brain, which tends to maintain this
reversal in its sensory processing regions.
Thus, most information from the sense
organs crosses over to the opposite side
of the brain. Likewise, “maps” of the body
in the brain’s sensory areas are typically
reversed and inverted. But while a digital
camera simply forms an electronic image,
the eye forms an image that gets extensive
further processing in the brain.
The unique characteristic of the eye
that makes it different from other sense
organs, lies in its ability to take the
information from light waves, then
transform the characteristics of light into
neural signals that the brain can process.
79

absorb light energy and respond by creating
nerve impulses.
But why are there two sorts of
photoreceptors? Our eyes function
sometimes in near darkness and sometimes
in bright light. These two types of
processors involving distinct receptor cell
types named for their shapes have evolved
for this purpose.

TE
LA
N
G
AN
A

This happens in the retina, the lightsensitive layer of cells at the back of the
eye that acts much like the light-sensitive
chip in a digital camera. As with a camera,
things can go wrong. For example, the
lenses of those who are “nearsighted” focus
images short of (in front of) the retina; in
those who are “farsighted,”the focal point
extends behind the retina. Either way,
images are not sharp without corrective
lenses.

Cells and tissues in the Eye

The real work in the retina is performed
by light-sensitive cells known as
photoreceptors. These photoreceptors
consist of two different types of
specialized cells the rods and cones that

About 125 million tiny rods containing
the pigment rhodopsin are present in our

their combinations. Thus the yellow field,

With movements of our eyeballs, we use
the fovea to scan whatever interests us
visually, the features of a face or, perhaps,
a flower.
There are other types of cells in the
retina that do not respond directly to light.
These handle the job of collecting impulses
from many photoreceptors (rods and
cones) and shuttling them on to the nerve
cells. Presence of some other receptor
cells sensitive to edges and boundaries of
objects and those that respond to light and
shadow and motion in the retina have also
been reported recently.
Bundled together, the nerve cells make
up the optic nerve, which transport visual
information from the eye to the brain.
Again, it is important to understand that
the optic nerve carries no light. Only
patterns of nerve impulses conveying
information derived from the incoming
light is carried. Each of the eyes collects
slightly different view of an object. The
brain puts the two views together and a three
dimensional picture is formed.
Strangely, there is a small area of the
retina in each eye where everyone is blind,
because that part of the retina has no
photoreceptors. This blind spot is located
at the point where the optic nerve exits each
eye, and the result is a gap in the visual field.
You do not experience blindness there
because what one eye misses is registered
by the other eye, and the brain “fills in” the
spot with information that matches the
background.

Eye protection

Each eye is protected by eyelids, eye
lashes, eye brows and lacrimal or tear
glands. A thin membrane covers the front
part of the eye. This membrane is called
conjunctiva. The conjunctiva is made up of
transparent epithelium. It is also a
protective cover to the eye. Whenever
unwanted substances come in contact with
this layer, the lacrimal glands are stimulated
to wash these substance out of the eye. The
fluids that are filled in the eyeball (vitreous
and aqueous chambers) protect the lens and
other parts of the eye from mechanical
shocks. Cornea is the clean window in the
sclera in front of the Iris. It protects the
eye from direct exposure to light.

olfaction, begins with chemical events in
the nose. There, odour (in the form of
airborne chemical molecules) interact with
receptor proteins associated with
specialized nerve cells. These cells,
incidentally, are the body’s only nerve cells

nose, are highly sensitive to odour
chemicals. These odour chemicals can be
complex and varied. For example, freshly
brewed coffee owes its scent to as many
as 600 volatile compounds (substances that
reach gaseous state quickly as they have low
boiling points.)
z List out how many odours you are
able to smell?
More broadly, scientists have cataloged
at least 1,500 different odour-producing
chemicals. Exactly how the nose makes
sense of so many odours is not completely
understood, but we do know that nasal
receptors sense the different types of odour
molecules.
We also know that the receptor cells
of nose transform information about the
stimulus into nerve signals and convey it
to the brain’s smell centers located on the
underside of the brain. There, our
sensations of smell are initially processed
and then passed on to many other parts of
the brain. Unlike all the other senses, smell
signals are not relayed through the
hypothalamus an important part of brain that
coordinates our nervous system and
endocrine or hormone secreting system.

there: The senses of taste and smell have a

So many of the subtle distinctions you may
think of as flavours really come from
odours. (Much of the “taste” of an onion is
odour, not flavour. And when you have a
cold, you’ll notice that food seems
tasteless because your nasal passages are
blocked.)

Most people know that our sense of
taste, or gustation, involves four primary
qualities or dimensions: sweet, sour, bitter,
and salty. Generally our Telugu people
consider six types of tastes (Shadruchulu)
which includes spicyness, vagaru but
actually they are tastes.
Less well known, however, is a fifth
taste called umami . Umami is the savoury
flavour found in protein-rich foods, such
as meat, seafood, and cheese. .

SC
ER

Metallic taste is the taste of some
artificial processed food material.
The taste receptor cells, located in the
taste buds on the top and side of the tongue,
sample flavours from food and drink as they
pass by on the way to the stomach. These
taste receptors cluster in small mucousmembrane projections called papillae.
Each is especially sensitive to molecules
of a particular shape.
Moving beyond the receptors on the
tongue, a specialized nerve “hotline”
carries nothing but taste messages to
specialized regions of the brain.

piece of cloth. Give her/him a piece of
ginger, garlic, tamarind, banana and jaggery
one by one. Ask her/him to taste by just
taking these, one at a time on the tongue.
Remember that your friend needs to rinse
his /her mouth between each test.
Could your friend tell the taste by just
putting the substances on the tongue?
Now repeat the above experiment by
asking your friend to take a bite and press
the food on the palate. What difference does
he or she feel now?
As food enters our mouth, we bite and
chew it and press it against the palate with
our tongue. This releases the chemicals in
food that trigger off our taste buds to act
and carry stimulus to the brain to be
processed for recognition of taste. The
same taste bud is capable of producing
different signals corresponding to the
different chemicals in food.

Activity-11
Observe your tongue by standing in
front of the mirror by protruding it out.
See how many different kinds of
structures you can see on your tongue.

Sense Organs

epithelial cells, surrounding the taste
buds form taste cells or the receptors.
The receptor cells and the cells
supporting them are situated in the
cavity. Each receptor cell connects to a
nerve fibre. All the nerve fibres connect
to main nerves that carry messages to
the brain and spinal cord for further

Skin is the outer most covering of our
body. It regulates the body temperature and
eliminates certain waste materials through

sense of touch is done by the cutaneous
receptors. It is the largest organ of all. It
provides the first level of protection to the
body.

The colour of the skin is due to the
presence of the pigment, called “Melanin”.
This pigment gets stimulation, when
exposed to sun light. The skin becomes dark
to protect other layers of the skin from
harmful effects of light. Skin is sensitive
to touch, temperature and pressure. It
contains the separate receptors such as
tactile receptors for touch, pacinian
corpuscles for pressure, nociceptors for
temperature etc.

It contains cutaneous receptors for touch.
The skin consists of two main layers, called
epidermis and dermis.
Epidermis is the layer for protection.
It has sweat pores and small hairs. It
contains three layers. They are outer
stratum corneum or cornified layer
containing dead cells, middle granular layer
containing living cells and inner malpigian
layer containing the cells dividing
constantly. Dermis lies below the
epidermis. It is made up of elastic
connective tissue. It contains sweat glands,
sebaceous glands, hair follicles, blood
vessels and fats.

Observe the above figures. You must
have observed all these things in your
surroundings. While observing them you
might have got questions like these.
z Why do fish need not learn to swim?
z How can butterfly find nectar?
z How do ants search their food and
pass information to each other about
this?
z Who teaches a bird how to make a
nest?
In this lesson we will try to understand
about why animals behave in a specific way.
Is there any pattern in their behaviour?
What are the factors that affect their
behaviour?

What do we mean by Animal
Behaviour?
Animal Behaviour is the scientific
94

study of the interaction of animals with
each other, with other living beings, and
with the environment. It explores how
animals relate to their physical
environment as
well as to other
organisms, and
includes topics
such as how
animals find and
defend resources,
avoid predators, Fig-2 : Weaver bird
choose mates,
reproduce, and care for their young ones.
The study of animal behaviour begins
with understanding how an animal’s
Physiology and Anatomy are integrated
with its behaviour. Both external and
Animal Behaviour

internal stimuli prompt behaviours
External stimuli includes the sounds,
smells, threats from other animals and
weather. Internal stimuli includes hunger
and fear. Scientists are drawn to the study
of animal behaviour for varied reasons and
the field is extremely broad, ranging from
research on feeding behaviour and habitat
selection to mating behaviour and social
organizations.

What is going on in the Fig-3?
z Will you consider spinning the
web by spider as an instinct
behaviour? Why or why not?
If your hand touches something hot or
sharp object, accidentally it automatically
moves away. This is because of reflex
action. Reflexes are also a type of instinct
behaviour. We do not have to learn them.
z Give two examples of reflexes.

There are several types of behaviours
in humans and other animals that have been

2. Imprinting
3. Conditioning
4. Imitation

1. Instinct

SC
ER

Instinctual behaviours are the
behaviours that need not be learned. They
can be complex like making nest by birds,
choosing mates and forming into groups for
protection etc. Observe the following
figure.

You might have observed this type of
situations. Chickens and ducklings are able to
walk almost immediately after hatching from
the egg. Duckling can even swim after a few
days. They recognise their mother because of
a behaviour type called imprinting.

Fig-4 : Hen with pullets

Ducklings will follow the first moving
object they meet after hatching. They
become socially attached to this object and
treat it as their mother. Imprinting lets
young animals recognise their mother from
a young age. They follow her for food and
protection.
Imprinting is useful if the first moving
object they see really is their mother. But
ducklings will imprint on people, balls and
even cardboard boxes if these happen to be
the first things they see.
95

z

Try to find out more examples of
imprinting from your surrounding.

Do you know?
Konrad Lorenz (1903 to 1989) was an
Austrian scientist who studied animal behaviour.
He discovered that if he reared geese (give local
name of this) since they hatched; they became

TE
LA
N
G
AN
A

imprinted on him. They followed him around

and preferred to be near to him even when they
had grown into adult geese. He received Nobel
Prize in 1973 for his contribution in physiology
and medicine.

3. Conditioning

SC
ER
T

Conditioning is a type of behaviour
involving a response to a stimulus that is
different from the natural one. It is a type
of learned behaviour.
If we take ringing of school bell as an
example, student shows different types of
conditioning to a school bell as per the
time.
When the school bell rings in the
morning, students gather for assembly.
When school bell rings at the end of
break time, the students leave the
playground and go to their classrooms.
When school bell rings at the last
period students rush to leave their
classroom.
There is one stimulus of ringing the
school bell, but students show different
responses to it. It is only because, by their
experiences they had learnt when to
perform which function. They would be
wrong sometimes.
Ivan Pavlov (1849 to 1936) was a
Russian scientist who has investigated
96

conditioning. He discovered that dogs
produced extra saliva when they were
offered food. This is a natural response to
a stimulus - food, which makes a dog's
mouth watery. The saliva produced is
needed to start digesting food and to make
swallowing food easier.
Pavlov noticed
that they also did the
same when the
person who fed
them came into the
room, even if the
person had not
brought any food.
Ivan Pavlov
Pavlov went on to
ring a bell at the
start of feeding time, and eventually the
dogs produced extra saliva when they heard
the bell, before any food was brought in.
He presented a stimulus (Ex: The soundbell) and then gave the dog food. After few
repetitions, the dog started to salivate in
response to the stimulus (food).

Fig-5 : Dog Experiment

A dog starts salivating when it hears a
bell is not a natural response. They would
not do this without being conditioned to
do so. The behaviour has been learned. It's
called a conditioned response.
Animal Behaviour

4. Imitation

TE

Fig-6 : Electric fences stop grazing
animals straying

Imitation is a type of behaviour where
one animal copies another animal. Humans
often imitate each other, often without
realising it. When people talk to each other,
they may stand or sit in a similar way, and
copy each other’s movements. Scientists
think that this happens so that the speakers
feel more at ease with other.
Some scientists think that humans are
the only animals that copy each other. Other
scientists have observed chimpanzees and
other primates imitating each other. For
example Kohler observed that, chimpanzees
can use sticks to spear juicy grubs to eat.
Other chimpanzees copy this behaviour. In
this way they learn new skills. Do you ever
heard monkey imitate us. Read and discuss
about the story 'Monkey and Hat merchant.

SC
ER
T

People and animals can be conditioned
to avoid certain things. For example,
grazing animals like sheep get an
unpleasant electric shock when they touch
an electric fence.
They eventually avoid the fence, even
when it is turned off.
Can you recall some other examples
of conditioning? try to enlist at least five
of them.

Fig-7 : Behaviour of Chimpanzee

Human behaviour

Humans show same types of behaviour
as other animals. But human behaviour is
often more complex because we are more
intelligent and aware of ourselves.
Let us study about the various methods
of behaviour in humans.
Free distribution by T.S. Government 2020-21

Instinct
Humans have instincts, but it is
possible for us to overcome natural urges
to follow certain behaviour. For example,
hungry persons might start eating
immediately when they sit down at the
dining table, but they have learned that good
manners means they should wait until
everyone is seated and ready to eat.
97

Imitation

Conditioning

Conditioning can be used to change the
behaviour of people. Advertisers are very
skilled at this. They use pictures of their
products which make them look glamorous
or exciting, often by using famous actors
or sports people. By associating the
product with attractive images the
advertisers are trying to set up a
conditioned response to their product.
People will respond positively and buy the
product.

SC
ER
T

Investigating behaviour

Behaviour can be investigated in the
‘field’ or in the laboratory. It can be
observed and measured, and experiments
can be designed to test how it works.
Human behaviour is affected by many
variables. It can be more difficult to study
the behaviour of other animals.

Investigations in the field

Some scientists spend many hours
watching and studying the behaviour of
animals. They may be interested in how the
animals live alone, group into families or
form large groups such as herds.
98

Animals can signal to each other. For
example, they may call each other to warn
danger. Some scientists are interested in
such signals. They record and study them
to work out what the signals mean, you
would have observed how ants respond
when they meet one another.

TE
LA
N
G
AN
A

People often imitate each other. This
can help them learn something new and
useful, such as new skill in lessons, sport
or at work. It can also lead them to show
less useful or harmful behaviour. For
example, young people may start smoking,
drinking alcohol or taking drugs as a result
of copying each other to ‘fit in’. But it is
very dangerous to our health.

Tagging

You have studied about bird migration
in the chapter biodiversity and its
conservation. Like birds some other
animals also migrate over large distances
to find food or nesting sites. Animals can
be ‘tagged’ by attaching tracking devices to
them. Tagging help scientists follow the
journeys the animals make.

Lab Activity

The work of Lorenz and Pavlov has been
mentioned in the earlier sections. These
scientists studied animal behaviour under
controlled conditions.
You can also study the behaviour of
cockroach. For this you will need a choice
box. You can make a choice box by

teacher about pheromones)
Let us know some interesting behaviour

They collect food material by injecting its
venom (usually other larvae) and keep in
its hive. Wasp lay its eggs on the food
material, which is used as food for larvae
of wasps.

Some experiments towards
animal intelligence
Let people believe or not, cheating /
bluffing, hiding are also characteristic
features of intelligence In other words,we
can say that you know what others think of
you and vice versa. In order to make them
confused, you do something that others can
not guess your plans. Not only humans, but
there are some other animals also that
show the same behaviour.

A bird called scrubjay hides its food.
But unfortunately when it searches back its
own food, it finds that another scrub jay had
stolen them. An experiment proved that a
scrubjay had hidden its food in presence
of another bird. After some time it was
found that the other bird had stolen it by
fixing a plan.

Fig-13 : Squirrels

Squirrels too hide their food in a
fascinating way. They always behave in such
a manner that somebody is trying to steal
their food. In order to misguide others they
dig holes in many places and heap leaves,
straw etc., to cover them. Sometimes, most
of the holes does not contain any food. In
this way, they cheat others to make believe
that these holes contain food. Some times
it forgets the place. In nature it helps in
spreading of seeds.

If we think of logic, we must remember
Dolphins. Dolphins have great logical
thinking power.

studied four bottle nose Dolphins at Kavalo
Basin mammal labarotory of Hawai islands.
He named them Akkikomoi, Phoenix, Allen
and Hippo.

Fig-14 : Dolphins playing

ER

He could understand by his study that
Dolphins can remember their names and
understand a code language if they are
trained by practice. Even they could reply
to complex code language. For example,
the closed fist shows a tub, raised arms
show a ball and one hand raised tells 'bring
here'. The altogether actions are understood
by the Dolphins. If we show the above
actions in a sequence, the Dolphins would
bring the ball from the tub. If we reverse
the actions they throw the ball into the tub.
They remember their names by short
and long whistles.Variety of whistles are
recognised by them. If a Dolphin of
particular whistle is called, all the dolphins
stare at ,while the particular one comes to
you.
Another wonder behaviour is remarked
with Alex, an African grey parrot. In 1977,
Irene Pepperberg bought a parrot and
trained it. Slowly she made it learn more

Likewise Alex could recognise even
minute similarities and differences
between any two objects irrespective of

other parrots of its group. When they utter
wrongly, it instructed them to say ‘clear’.
Besides, wonderful thing is that it calls
an apple as ‘Bannery’ because it tastes like

Animals also behave like us in most of
the situations. It is very interesting and
important to understand animal behaviour
to conserve bio-diversity. Ethology is the
scientific and objective study of animal
behaviour and a branch of zoology. The
focus of Ethology is on animal behaviour
under natural conditions. This is the
combination of laboratory and field science
with a strong relation to certain other
disciplines such as Neuroanatomy, Ecology
and Evolution. Ethology began during 1930
with the works of Dutch Biologist Nikolas
Tinbergen and by Austrian biologist Konrad
Lorenz and Karlvon Frisch. They got Nobel
prize for their works on animal behaviour
in 1973.

Every species in animal kingdom has
its own standards of intelligence which
reflects through their behaviour. Animals
also express feelings like happiness, threat,
fear, anger, sadness etc. Your pet dog is a
best example to observe different types of
feelings. After returning from fields in the
evening cow licks its calf. It reflects its
affection towards its calf. You also see this
different types of behaviour in other
animals.
Hissing of snakes, barking of dogs,
stiffing of spike of hedgehog (Mulla

Whenever the beetle feels threatened,
these chemicals mix with some special

Animals show different types of behaviour.
Animal behaviour is the scientific study of the ways in which animals interact with
each other, with other living beings, and with the environment.
Finding of resources and defending them, avoiding predators, choosing mates,
reproduction, and taking care of their young etc are examples of some of animal
behaviour.
Scientists categorize animal behaviour into different categories like, Instinct,
Imprinting, Conditioning, Imitation.
Human behaviour is more complex because we can control our behaviour and aware
of ourselves.
Animal behaviour can be investigated in controlled conditions as well as in the field.
The scientific study of animal behaviour is called Ethology.

0.14 square kilometers. Can you estimate
how much area of land would be required
to grow the quantity of grain needed for
your family in a year? You know if the
members of a family increase, food
requirement also increases accordingly. If
the requirement doesn't meet it, this leads
to food crisis. We know that population of
our country increases every year. Is the food
production able to meet the need of
increasing population? Does the rate of
food production increase proportionately
to population growth? We shall try to find
out the answers to some of such questions
by doing the following exercise.

z Share your ideas with classmates. What
are the common suggestions in your list?
Apart from human beings, other living
creatures also need food to survive. Many
of these animals have been domesticated
and live with us. So we need to provide them
fodder, grain etc.

In this chapter, we shall discuss what
methods are used to increase the
production of the crops that we grow for
food. There is one thing that needs to be
stressed when we talk about increasing
production. It can be explained more easily
through an example. Suppose we plant a
crop of rice and wheat. Suppose the plants
grow healthy but they do not produce any
grain. Would you call this a good wheat
crop? So when we talk about increasing
production, what we mean is increasing that
part of the crop that is useful for us.

Let us now begin our discussion on
increasing production.
The production of a crop does not
increase because of any one factor alone.
Only when there is a proper combination
of several factors, the production can
increase. Some of these factors include the
kind of seeds planted, the properties of the
soil, the availability and proper application
of irrigation and fertilizers, the weather,
controlling insect attacks, the growth of
weeds and so on.

Experiments done with corn have shown the impact of some of these factors on crop
production. Some results of these experiments are given in the following table.

The table shows us the gains achieved
in production by using different methods.
For example, planting the seed at the
correct time resulted in a production gain
of 5,830. k.g/hectare. Planting after one
month after the onset of rains resulted in
production gain of 3,400 k.g/hectare.
Which means the production reduced by
2,430 k.g/hectare.
Calculate the exact gain from each
method mentioned in the table and note the
results in the table.
You now have some idea about some of
the factors that affect the production of
various crops.

How to increase the food
production?
We know that the cultivated land is
very limited. If we make use of plenty of
land for cultivation some forests may be
destroyed. This leads to environmental
problems. So we need to think of another
solution. Observe the following solutions.
1. Increasing the area of cultivated land.
2. Increasing production in the existing
land.
3. Developing high yielding varieties.
4. Crop rotation
5. Cultivating Mixed crops.
6. Cultivating short term crops like
wheat, mustard etc.
107

Which of the above option do you
think is more meaningful?
You have already learnt about long term
and short term crops or Kharif and Rabi
crops in your VIII class. Short term varieties
produce grains more than long term
varieties.
Alternating of crops preserve the soil
fertility. Mixed crop system helps the
farmers to produce variety of crops as well
as increase in the production.
To get high yield 3 types of methods
are being used.
1. Developing high yielding varieties.
2. Using high yield management methods.
(Crop production management)
3. Crop protection management.

High yielding crop management methods:

(A) Irrigation
An experiment was conducted to find out
how irrigation affected the production of a
crop. In the experiment, crops were grown in
two fields. One field was irrigated while the
other wasn’t. The same amount of nutrients,
like nitrogen, was applied to both the fields.
However, the amount of nitrogen was
increased by the same quantity for both the
irrigated and unirrigated fields. The results
of the experiment are illustrated in Graph-1.

You may have wondered what

is one such carbohydrate. Different types
of sugars and cellulose are also
carbohydrates. A chemical analysis will
show that 100 grams of water reacts with
260 grams of carbon dioxide to form 180
grams of carbohydrates.
But the plant roots do not use all the
water they absorb to produce
carbohydrates. Actually, most of this water
evaporates into the air.

Most of the farmers of our state
cultivate crops like paddy, sugar cane
irrespective of proper availability of water,
only because of supporting price and
marketing facility. So farmers invest more
on irrigation of water, electricity bills,
pesticides and fertilizers. Agriculture

Plants also absorb different kinds of
mineral salts from the soil, in addition to
water. Among these are the salts that plants
require in larger quantities. For example,
plants need Nitrogen, Phosphorus and
Potassium salts in larger quantities. These
are called Macronutrients. Some nutrients
are necessary for plants in small quantities.
These are called Micronutrients. Ex: Iron,
Manganese, Boron, Zinc, Copper,
Molybdenum, Chlorine, Nickel etc.
These mineral nutrients are obtained
from the soil. When we grow a crop, the

Usually, farmers do not grow only one
crop in a field. Different crops are grown
in different seasons. It has been seen that
cereal crops take a lot of nutrients from
the soil, but legume crops are different.
While they do take nutrients from the soil,
they also provide some nutrients to it.
Growing leguminous crops result in an

increase in the quantity of nitrogenous salts
in the soil. Thus to grow a leguminous crop
between cereal crops is beneficial either
by croprotation or by mixed cropping.

112

What is the benefit of crop rotation?
When cereals are cultivated repeatedly,
more nutrients are utilized. If legumes are
grown in the soil, less nutrients are utilized.
Not only this, they synthesize some
nutrients into the soil. Do you find any crop
rotation methods in your village? What are
they? Ask your village elders and collect
the information about it.

Is betel (Tamalapaku) a mixed crop?
How can you justify your answer?
Can you name some leguminous crops?

Leguminous crops usually have many
small nodules on their roots. Different
kinds of bacteria live in these nodules.
Some of these bacteria absorb nitrogen
from the air and convert it into a form that
can be used by the plant. You will learn more
about nitrogen fixation in Bio-Geochemical cycles.
z Ask your teacher about names of the
nitrogen fixing bacteria.
You could uproot a Soya bean plant or
a Bengal gram plant to see the nodules on
their roots.

Root nodules in legume plants
The microorganisms in the nodules use
some of the nitrogen for their own purpose.
Some nitrogen is used by the leguminous
plant itself. But after the crop is harvested,
the roots remain in the soil. So the soil gets
some nitrogen in this way.
Experiments have shown that a
leguminous crop gives about 50 kg to 150
kg of nitrogen per hectare. The crop grown
after the leguminous crop can take
advantage of the availability of more
nitrogen in the soil.

The organic (natural) manure is
produced by decaying the plant and animal
wastes! The manure produced from
decomposed plant and animal products has
more organic material. This gives good
nutrients to the soil. It makes the soil
fertile. Because of humus, the natural
manure, water holding capacity of soil
increases.
Natural organic manures are generally
divided into two types. 1) Concentrated
organic manures, 2) Macro organic manure.
Groundnut, Gingelly, Castor, Coconut,
Neem, Jatropha seed powders are the
examples of Concentrated organic
manures. These are also used as fodder for
cattle and poultry.
Animal excreta, compost, deep litter
are the examples of macro organic manure.
Nutrients are rich in the concentrated
organic manures than in macro organic
manure.
By organic manure we normally mean
the plant and animal residues in the field,
such as stalks and roots, cow-dung, urine
etc. The percentage of various nutrient
elements in one ton of organic manure is
given in Table 5.

Fig-8 : Root Nodules

SC
ER
T

Nowadays a bacterial culture is also
available. This is mixed with the seeds.
When the seeds are sown, the plants are able
to produce more nodules on their roots.
Apart from this, there are various kinds
of blue-green algae that add nitrogen to the
soil. Blue-green algae culture is also
available. It is applied in rice fields.
So if a leguminous crop is rotated with
a cereal crop, the leguminous crop
replenishes, to some extent, the nitrogen
taken from the soil by the cereal crop. But
Potassium, Phosphorus and other nutrient
elements cannot be replenished in this way.

nutrient management. Let us read the
following case study to know about vermi
compost.
The farmers are Bomma Raju Cheruvu
of Vinjamur Mandal faced many problems
in using of chemical fertilizers. They
searched for alternate practices. Farmers
understand the importance of soil health.
They formed a group to grow vermi
compost with the help of Agriculture Field
Officers of DOT centre.
They constructed 10X1X1/2 meters
vermi compost beds in sheds which protect

these beds from direct sunlight and rain.
They collected coconut, banana and
sugarcane leaves, coconut coir and dry
black gram plants. They made them into 3
to 4 inches layer. This inner layer was wet
with water. They collected house hold
waste of dry cattle dung from the village
to fill the bed. They did not use, wet dung.
They were careful to avoid glass,
polythene, rubber and metal objects in the
bed.
After two weeks of making bed, they
kept thousand earth worms per square
meter and covered the bed with Gunny
bags to maintain 30 to 40% of moisture.
After 60 days they collected their first
manure. Second time they, got the manure
within 40 to 45 days. Every year they got
the manure 6 times from these beds. They
got one ton of compost from three tonnes
of organic wastes. They said that after using
this organic manure, investment on
chemical fertilizers and other pesticides
became reduced and the quality of their
agricultural products increased.

levels. If you send the sample of soil from
your field, they send you a report after
testing it. By the report you will be able
to know that which nutrient is lesser and
which is more. This helps the farmer to
select the type of crop, manure, fertilizer
etc and its quantity. This prevents wastage
and minimizes investment.

This is also a natural manure. The main
ingredients of Panchgavya are milk, curd,

and cow ghee. Settle it for four days. On
the fifth day, add urine, milk and curd of
cow. Also add toddy, coconut water and
sugarcane juice to the mixture. And then
add banana paste. Settle it for ten days. Stir
the material morning and evening. Then you
will get Panchagavya the only sprayer type
of manure. 3% of Panchgavya is helpful to
grow crop with higher yield. It is also used
as food for hens and fish in ponds.

By using chemical fertilizers, we can
get high yield for only 20 to 30 years. After
that soil becomes reluctant to plant growth.
These chemicals damage soil fertility. If
the soil health is proper, then only the soil
responds to fertilizers. Otherwise, usage
of fertilizers become mere waste.
Long term high yielding capacity of
soil (soil productivity) depends on both
availability of nutrients in the soil (soil
fertility) and suitable physical, chemical
and biological characters of soil (soil
health).
To maintain soil productivity organic
farming came into existence. This is our
ancient practice. In this type of farming,
farmers use natural manures and natural
pest controlling methods and they also
practice crop rotation and mixed crop
systems.
In organic farming farmers use biofertilizers, instead of using chemical
fertilizers and synthetic pyrethroids
(insecticides), to get higher yielding.
Some micro-organisms are useful to
synthesize nutrients from the
environment or from soil to plants. These
are called 'microbial cultures' or
'bio-fertilizers'.

Chemical Fertilizers

You may have heard names like Urea,
NPK and Superphosphate. These are
chemical nutrients. These are partially or
completely synthetic in origin.
We have already seen that plants get
many of their nutrients from the soil. The
quantity of nutrients in the soil decreases
if plants continue to absorb them. We have
also seen some ways in which soils
replenish their nutrient content. There is
one other way in which soils can receive
nutrients by adding chemical fertilizers.

But whether we use organic manure
or compost or chemical fertilizers, it is not
enough to know the percentage of nutrient
elements they contain. It is important to
know how much of this nutrient is finally
available to the plant. It is also necessary
to know which is the best time to provide
the nutrients so that the plant can make the
fullest use of them. We must also examine
which is the best way to add the nutrients
to the soil. For example, would it be better

It is not necessary that the production
of all crops increases equally if an equal
amount of nutrients are supplied. The type
of crop determines the effect of the
nutrients. For example,the effect of
applying nitrogen fertilizers on an
indigenous rice variety (Peta) and a hybrid
rice variety (IR-8) is shown in Graph-3.

Suppose 120 kg of nitrogen per hectare
are added to a crop of Sonora-64 wheat. A
total of 5.3 tons of wheat will be produced.
On the basis of Table 2, calculate how
much of phosphorus and potassium will be
absorbed from the field by this wheat crop.
Is it advisable to add only nitrogenous
fertilizer to increase production? What
effect will this have on other nutrients in
the soil? Explain with reasons. Now let us

Suppose we take best variety of seeds,
sow them at the correct time, apply
fertilizers properly at proper intervals and
irrigated well. Will there be any obstacle
in getting a good crop?
There are many other factors that affect
a crop production. Let’s look at some of
them.

Weeds

Often, in a field along with the crop
plants other unwanted plants grow. These
plants are called 'weeds'.
z Do you know any names of weeds in
paddy field?
z What effect do weeds have on a crop?
Before trying to answer this question,
discuss the following points in your class:
z How would weeds affect the supply of
nutrients to the crop?
z How would they affect the sunlight
available to the crop?
z What effect will there be on the water
available for the crop?
119

Will these factors affect crop
production? Look at the crop figures

Activity-3

The diseases caused by insects and
microorganisms effect crop production. The
question is, how should we deal with this
problem? Nowadays, farmers use
Insecticides, Fungicides and other
chemicals. However, there are other ways
to solve the problem. For example, weeding
help to get rid of weeds from fields. Or
insects can be captured and removed from
the fields.
Insecticides are actually chemicals.
They are used to kill insects.
Ask your teacher about whether insects
can develop immunity to the Insecticides
used to destroy them? Immunity means the
insecticide no longer has any effect on the
insect it targets.
There is another problem when we use
insecticides to kill pests or Weedicides/
Herbicides to destroy weeds. A large
percentage of these chemicals remain in the
soil. From the soil, these chemicals find
their way into water sources.

Make a list of the major weeds in your
area. Find out which weeds grow with which
crops. If possible, collect these weeds and
make display. Find out what farmers do to
get rid of these weeds.

Insects and plant diseases

Apart from weeds, plants are affected
by insect attacks. Some insects eat the
stems of plants, some nibble at the leaves,
while others destroy the roots. But there
are also insects that are useful for plants.
For example, many insects help in the
pollination of plants.

SC
ER
T

There are several microorganisms that
destroy plants. We cannot see them, but we
can see the destruction they cause in plants.
These include shriveling and discolouration
of leaves, rusting of the stem and leaves,
fungal growths etc.

Do you think that a chemical used to kill
insects will have no effect on humans?
People who spray these chemicals in the
fields are exposed to them and some of the
chemicals enter into lungs, blood and shows
its effect in their bodies and show long term.

Another problem is that these
chemicals destroy all insects. We have seen
earlier that some of these insects are useful
and helpful to plants. Prakasam and Guntur
districts of Andhra Pradesh state are the
places where pesticides and insecticides
are used in large quantities.

Some people ask this question: If we
don't use these chemicals, how can we
get a good crop? How can we increase
production? Is there an answer to this
question? What could it be?

SC
ER
T

Suppose, we can use some other
methods that do not give rise to these
problems. For example, they say we can
make use of the natural food chains to
control pests. Remember, we had
discussed food chains in the chapter
‘Different Ecosystems’. There are many
insects that eat other insects. They are
called predatory insects. We can make use
of these insects. There are also birds that
eat insects. We can use these birds to get
rid of insects.

Similarly, people say we can capture
harmful insects and kill them. The problem
is that this method is both slow and time

consuming. However, supporters of this
method say the process can be speeded up.
For example, if a lighted bulb (Deepapu
Teralu) is placed in a field, insects would
cluster around it. It makes easy to capture
them.
z Discuss with your friends and try to
find out some other alternates for
pesticides.

Natural pest controlling
methods
Generally farmers use synthetic
Pyrithroids like Pesticides, Insecticides to
control pests on crops. There are so many
natural pest controlling techniques.
z Which methods are followed by our
farmers?
Some insects control the harmful
insects and they are called friendly insects.
Spiders, Dragon fly, Chrysola Mirids, Lady
bird beetle, etc., are the insects that eat
larvae of Jassids, Thrips, and Stem borers.

Hybridization as a process to yield high yielding variety of rice in India for commercial
production was started in 1911. It was started by Dr. G. P. Hector, the erstwhile Economic
Botanist during 1911 in undivided Bengal with headquarters at Dacca (now in Bangladesh).
Subsequently, in 1912, a crop specialist was appointed exclusively for rice in Madras
Province. Prior to the establishment of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)
in 1929, Bengal and Madras were the only provinces which had specialist exclusively for
rice crop. Later several other research stations were opened which released 445 improved
varieties of rice by 1950. These varieties were of various characters such as-giving produce
early, deep water and flood resistant, drought resistant, disease resistant etc
The hybrid varieties that are produced by hybridization techniques are high yielding,
disease resistant, can thrive on less rainfall and will grow in acidic soils also.
You people also can develop your own hybrid varieties. It’s very interesting to do.

result whole diversity of the food grains. Traditional and local varieties become
extinct.Such mono-cultural practices lead to increasing uncontrollable pests and diseases
on plants. For this farmers use pesticides beyond limits. This causes undesirable damage
to the eco system. For example cultivation of B.T. Cotton and Brinjal seed varieties
resulted in committing suicides of farmers. Multinational companies impose the countries

becomes successful and beneficial when
you implement the right pattern.
Usually it is difficult to yield 30 bags
of paddy from an acre, but I yield 92 bags

Most of the farmers are in wrong notion
that SRI vari is a special type of seed. Actually, SRI vari is a system of cultivation in which
we require less water and seeds. The real meaning of SRI is System of Rice Intensification.
You can select any seed for this purpose. In this pattern of cultivation to get one kilo of
paddy, we require only 2500 to 3000 litres of water. Where as in traditional system, for the
production of same quantity of paddy, we require 5000 litres of water.
We should not prefer to cultivate a single crop, rather we should practice mixed crop
for yielding. We should not blindly follow the ways and means what other farmers do."

We found that there were differences

We can see differences within ecosystems
in very small areas as well.
We have studied in class VI in the
chapter 'habitat' about the variations in the
living organisms, as well as organisms
present at different levels, in the pond
ecosystem and the tree. In this chapter we
will see how organisms have started
inhabiting certain areas? What needs they
have? And how they acquire adaptations to
different conditions from their
surroundings to meet them?
To adjust themselves to diverse and
distinct changes in ecosystems, organisms
have to adapt different means for better
survival. For example, some trees such as
Mangroves like Avicennia have evolved a
curious way to deal with the problems of
growing in a wet and salty place. They have
evolved to have curiously appearing

These aerial roots develop from the
lateral roots that are growing near the
surface, and protrude up to 12 inches out
of the soil or sediment. They aid the plants
in maintaining adequate root respiration in
saline marshy environment. We do not find
such structures in plants growing around us.
All such ways and means that organisms
adopt or develop over a certain period of
time in different conditions for better
survival are adaptations of organisms. We
may also say that adaptation is a feature that
is common in any population because it
provides some improvements for better
survival.

surface or propping out of it. Plant it in a

What do you observe? Compare
your observation with that of

findings?
From the above activity we see that
some plants dry up without water very
quickly, while others can grow even with
very little water. Each of these plants are
adapted to the conditions in their
surroundings on the basis of need of water.
What is meant by adaptations?
Organisms in nature adapt to situations
specifically. For example in Opuntia, the
leaves are reduced to spines so that
transpiration loss is checked and water is
stored in the tissues of the stem (succulent
stems). This helps the plant to live in
conditions of water scarcity such as
deserts and dry lands. Aloe vera is found
in our surroundings as well but you may
have heard that they are generally called as
desert plant (xerophyte).

Adaptations in Aquatic ecosystems
We shall study two different types of
ecosystems in water (aquatic ecosystems)
and some conditions in the environment that
influence adaptations.
Aquatic ecosystems are mainly
classified into two different types as Fresh
water and Marine ecosystems.
Ponds, Lakes, Rivers are the examples
of Fresh water Ecosystems
Seas, Oceans are the examples of
Marine Ecosystems
As the living conditions are different
we come across various adaptations in
several organisms living in these
ecosystems.
You may know animals that live in
water. Do you find in them any
suitable characters adopted to live
in water. Write a note on them in
your notebook.
General aquatic adaptation as can be
seen structurally (in body structure) are
like presence of some special air spaces
inside bodies or presence of such structures
that help organisms to swim and float in
water to inhabit different levels in the water
body. Some animals bear specialized
structures to swim such as flippers as in
Turtles and fins in fishes. Fishes and
Dolphins have floaters in their body
(special structures of their digestive canals)
to be able to inhabit particular levels in the
water body. Microscopic photosynthetic
organisms like phytoplanktons have
droplets of oil in their cells that keeps them
float. Larger plants have long broader leaves
and flexible stems.

Some animals show extraordinary
ability to survive in the desert.
The Kangaroo Rat of western North
American desert can live without
drinking water through out its life.
Because its body synthesizes little
water in the process of digestion.
The desert bird the Sand grouse flies
long distances to an oasis in search of
water, which it carries back in its crop
for its nestlings.
The furry soles of Fennec Fox helps it
walk on hot sand and loses heat through
its ears.
When the sand becomes too hot the sand

Animals which are active during
night and sleep during the day are called
Nocturnals. These creatures generally
have highly developed senses of hearing
and smell. They have specially adopted
eye sight to see well in dark. Animals like
bats, emit a high pitched sound which
bounses off objects to find prey and
protect from predators.
Cats, Rats, Bats, Owls are the
Nocturnals generally seen in our
suroundings. Some insects like Crickets,
Firefly and Fishes like Cuttle fish are
active during night only. Some desert
animals become nocturnals inorder to
escape extreme day time heat.

We know that organisms need shelter,
food, light, air and many other things for
their survival. Organisms often show
adaptation according to these requirements.

Secret of swimming
Swimming is the fundamental
characteristic feature of aquatic animals.
Their bodies have certain adaptation to
fight with pressure of underwater current.
Let us try to find out these secrets.
Yet, all sorts of other organisms thrive
at high pressure. Some of them are even
air-breathing surface dwellers like us.
Some Seals can dive up to a mile and some
Whales can go much deeper than that (these
are mammals like us). All these animals
seem to share the same secret: instead of
fighting the pressure, they let it shrinks
their lungs completely. Some oxygen
remains in their lungs, but they mostly
store it in their muscles, where it is needed;
their muscle tissue contains much higher
concentrations of oxygen-binding
chemical than our muscles.
Moreover, shrinked lungs give deepdiving mammals another big advantage,
once a seal’s lungs have shrinked, it
becomes heavier than water, and so it sinks.
Thus it doesn’t have to flap flippers all the
way down; it reaches great depths mostly
by gliding effortlessly, saving its oxygen
stores, for the strenuous climb back to the
surface.
The deep seafloor itself, well beyond
the range of diving mammals, is inhabited
by an incredible diversity of animals. Some

Over the last 2,000 million years, plant
and animal life on earth has continuously
evolved from its simple beginnings in the
oceans to the complex existence on land
today. It is no accident that protoplasm, a
substance found in every living cell,
strongly resembles seawater. Although
some animals emerged from the sea
millions of years ago to fill all available
places on land, some remained in the ocean
and evolved and adapted to life beneath the
surface.
The ocean covers a larger part of the
planet, yet it remains a little understood
place as scientists have limited scope for
the study of habitats that lack physical
boundaries and a span of thousands of
miles.
Each form of marine life has become
adapted to a specific area with a relatively
narrow variation in salinity, temperature,
and light. The high salt content found in the
ocean can support the large bodies of Giant
Squids and Whales, which has allowed them
to evolve without the use of strong limbs
for support. Nevertheless, salt water exerts
enormous pressure on the air spaces of
marine animals at depth fluids like blood
are practically incompressible. For every
10 meters pressure increases by one
atmosphere (105 Newton/metre2). You
studied about in the chapter ‘Force and

Pressure’ in VIII class Physical Science
text book and let us recall them.
This limits our study of occean depths

specifically designed to maintain one

to study the dramatically different
adaptations in marine life on a vertical scale
in the water.
Animals and plants living in surface
waters have access to high nutrient levels,
increased temperatures, reduced pressure,
and more light and therefore lack the
adaptations of deep sea creatures that must
live in high pressure, cold, dark waters with
scarce nutrients.
Marine life has adapted to an incredible
variety of conditions and habitats.
Barnacles and Mussels have developed
mechanisms that allow them to cling to
rocks in environments where they might
otherwise be easily washed out by strong
waves. Brightly-coloured Clownfish have
adapted symbiotic relationships with
Anemones to protect both the Clownfish
and the Anemone from predators. Some
Whales and herring gulls have adapted the
ability to travel long distances and the
ability to survive in a variety of
environments.
Marine adaptations also include
symbiosis, camouflage, defensive
behavior, reproductive strategies, contact
and communication like most other
ecosystems on earth and adaptations to
environmental conditions like pressure,
temperature, light and salinity.

of the fishes even have lung-like swim
bladders to control their buoyancy (ability
to float in a medium) e.g. Whales, Seal.
They move up in the water column by
releasing gas into the bladder and inflating
it, and down by reabsorbing gas into their
blood. Researchers have observed that such
fishes hang motionless a few feet above the
seafloor. A swim bladder does not shrinks
at depth because the gas inside is at the
same pressure as the water outside which
means if that external pressure suddenly
decreases, the bladder will swell greatly.
When such a fish is brought up from depth,
its swim bladder sticks out of its mouth.
Marine animals must also regulate the
interaction of freshwater and saltwater in
their bodies. Specially developed kidneys,
gills, and body functions help to maintain
salt concentrations across membranes
through osmosis. Marine animals must also
be able to take dissolved gases like oxygen
from the water needed to release the energy
from food. Animals, such as Anemones or
worms, take the gases through their skin.
Mobile animals use gills, or even lungs to
take oxygen from the water and air. All
animals in the ocean release carbon dioxide
into the water as waste, which is then used
by plants to produce energy.
Temperatures vary dramatically
between the surface and the ocean floor.
Marine life has developed many adaptations
to the variations in temperature. Many
marine mammals have blubber for
insulation from the cold, and some fishes
have an antifreeze-like substance in their
blood to keep it flowing. It is interesting

It is the ability to regulate this salt
absorption that determines the tolerance of
a freshwater fish for saline water. When the
water salinity level exceeds the fish’s
ability to adjust its salt regulation
mechanisms, the delicate salt and fluid
balance is upset and the fish dies.

Water salinity and fish adaptations

SC
ER
T

Different fish species have very
different tolerances for water salinity. All
marine and freshwater fish maintain a
constant internal salt concentration, which
is midway between that of fresh water and
sea water. Several marine species have a
lower internal salt concentration than that
of the water they swim in, so they tend to
dehydrate as water is lost by osmosis. To
compensate, they drink large amounts of
water, and excrete the salts both through
their kidneys and through highly
specialised cells in the gills.
In contrast, freshwater fish have a
higher internal salt content than their
medium, and they tend to float, because
osmosis leads to excess water entering the
body through the permeable membranes in
the mouth and gills. The water can be
excreted in the form of urine, but to
maintain a suitable salt balance freshwater
fish need to reabsorb salt through the
kidneys, and collect additional salts
through salt-collecting cells in the gills.
Free distribution by T.S. Government 2020-21

Organisms of the oceans have a
lesser salt content in their bodies
than the sea water which has around
3.5%. The fluid could drain out of
the body of the organism into the
sea. This could be dangerous and
fatal to the organism. How do they
survive under such conditions?
Can fish in estuarine ecosystem
survive in river as well as in sea?

During summer the water in the lakes
gets heated up and evaporates. Other
requirements necessary to the organisms,
like oxygen and nutrients gets decreased.
This leads to the death and decomposing
of organisms which makes living
conditions unsuitable. In cold regions, the
water in the lakes and ponds gets frozen,
killing all the organisms. You have studied

most of the algal colony that fails to
compete dies out. The more adaptive forms
of Algae live on to form symbiotic
relationship with the fungi in colonies
called Lichens. The figure shows such a
colony growing on a tree trunk. The fungus
provides water and minerals to the alga,
while the alga performs photosynthesis and
supplies food in the form of sugars to the
fungus. Due to such symbiotc adaptations
lichens are able to survive even in extreme
conditions.
Adaptation to environment is not a
simple phenomena. If we keep a cow in a
desert, will it be modified like a camel? If
a giraffee is kept in a forest with short trees
or plants it would not convert like a goat.
Adaptation takes place over a long period
of duration.

Many organisms that live in the hot
deserts or polar regions migrate to the
deeper layers of the earth to protect
themselves from the extreme conditions of
heat and cold. For example seasonal
adaptations can be seen in amphibians like
frog .To protect themselves from the
extremes of hot and cold conditions they
burrow deep in the ground and remain
motionless until the conditions are
favourable. During this period the rate of
metabolic activities slow down and the
animal goes into a nearly sleepy condition
called Hibernation (winter sleep) and
Aestivation (summer sleep).
Collect information about hibernation
and aestivation and make news

library or internet and also take your
teachers help for more examples.

Story of Darwin's Finches

Charles Darwin in the year 1885
landed from the famous ship H.M.S
Beagle on one of the islands of the
Galapagos islands. He studied about
different organisms of the islands. His
most remarkable observation had been
about Finches (our state bird is also a
finch). He was amazed to see that
different types of finches that differed
with respect to beaks and the colour of
feather were present in the small region
of the Galapagos islands. He noted that
some finches eat seeds,while some eat
fruits and the others eat insects.

Is there any relation between type
of food taken and the structure of
beak? Specify.
The seed eaters had thick and heavy
beaks.
The fruit eaters had stubby beaks.
The insect eaters had sharp and
long beaks. .
Darwin observed that these birds had
adapted to their immediate surroundings

for food and shelter and showed a lot of
variation even within the same species,
especially with respect to the form of
beaks. He made a sketch of the same as
shown in the above figure-19. Thus he
concluded that adaptation was something
that an organism is undergoing
continuously, even within very closely
related forms in a particularly
geographically separated area.

Organisms adjust to diverse conditions of the ecosystem for better survival by
adaptations.
Different adaptations are found in organisms of marine and fresh water ecosystems.
For their survival organisms have developed special characters to adapt themselves
to temperature, water availability, pressure etc.
Most of the xerophytic plants have fleshy, succulent and green coloured stem and
reduced leaves.
Marine ecosystem is divided as euphotic, bathyal and abyssal zones.
Fresh water ecosystem of a lake has littoral, limnetic and profundal zones.
In temperate regions, some plants shed their leaves before winter.
Animals in cold regions have thick fur coat and a fat layer below their skin that act
as insulators.
The factors that affect the aquatic ecosystems are salt content, oxygen, food, light
and pressure.
Animals living in the bottom layers of the sea are usually blind.
Hibernation and Aestivation seen in amphibians like frogs is an example of
adaptation.

Soil Pollution

Our planet consists of atmosphere
(air), lithophere (earth), hydrosphere
(water) and biosphere (living organisms)
are continuing for years together
interacting with each other. It was clean
and enjoyable. But due to the various
activities of man, the composition and
complex nature of environment got
changed. The activities include
industrialization,
construction,
transportation, agriculture deforestation
etc. These activities are desirable for
human development and welfare but these
release unwanted materials into the
environment causing an imbalanced that
makes our life miserable.
We have learnt about the structure
of soil formation and its properties in class
VII and also about air and water pollution
in previous class VIII. Here we will study
about ‘Land Pollution’. But before that, let
us recall what we have learnt about soil.
We the Indians consider the earth as
our mother. We get everything for our
living from soil. Recall, what you have
learnt in class VII.
148

What is soil?

Air, water and soil are three major
natural resources, alongside soil is one of
the marvellous products of nature without
which there would be no life. It is a natural
medium for plants to grow.

Air 25%

Minerals 45%

Water 25%

Organic
Matter 5%

and it also supports plant and animal life.
Healthy soil means the soil which
produces healthy plants, on eating which
animals also remain healthy.

How is soil formed?

Crop quality directly depends on
the quality of the agricultural soil in which
it is grown. The higher the quality of the
soil, the higher the quality of the crop
produced. To know the quality of the soil,
we must understand the fundamental
properties of it. These can be divided into
three major categories- physical, chemical
and biological properties.

TE
LA
N
G
AN
A

Soil formation is a long and complex
process and it can take 100 to 10,000 years
to create one inch of top soil It is driven by
many factors such as Climate, Topography,
living organisms and the type of parent
material. Parent materials come from break
down of underlying rocks or from deposits
by streams and rivers, seas and gulfs, hills,
wind and glaciers or organic plant residues.

Soil properties

SC
ER
T

Over the time, the parent materials are
weathered by the effects of freezing,
thawing, wetting, drying, heating, cooling,
erosion, plants, animals and chemical
reactions. Eventually the parent material is
divided into three horizontal layers. The top
layer consists of mostly organic matter and
biological activity, the middle layer is the
zone of maximum material accumulation
and the bottom layer is mainly the parent
material.

The top soil is important since it is the
foundation for the life on the earth.

Do you know?

In one acre of land where the top soil
is eight inches thick, nearly five and half
tons of bacteria are present. 50,000
Earthworms also live in it.

(i) Physical properties of soil

Soil comprises of minerals, organic
matter, water and air. The composition and
proportion of these components greatly
influence the physical properties of soil
including colour, texture, structure and
porosity. These properties regulate the air
and water movement in the soil and thus
affect the ability of soil to functions.
Organic matter is the organic component
of soil which includes the dead and
decaying plants, animals and residues of
organisms.
It consists of nutrients necessary for
plants growth such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus
and Potassium. Soils which contain 30%
or more organic matter are considered
organic soils; all other soils are identified
as mineral soils. Organic matter in soil
improves water infiltration, decreases
evaporation, and increases the water
holding capacity. The organic matter
contains numerous organisms which
convert the matter back to nutrients. These
organisms help to create a crumb, that is
ideal for cultivation. Thus, a natural state
of soil is maintained.
149

(ii) Chemical properties of soil
The term pH is used to indicate the level
of acidity or alkalinity of a soil. The range
of pH values of a good soil lies from 5.5
to 7.5. Below pH 7 the soils are termed as
acidic and above pH 7 alkaline.

The availability of Na, K, Ca, Mg and S
tends to decrease with decreasing pH.
Weathering and plant uptake also result in
removal of these nutrients or decrease in
microbial activity which makes soil acidic.
What happens if the acidic nature and
alkanlinity of the soil increases?

The pH of soil is important to know the
type of vegetation that grows in the soil and
the type of organisms that live there. Also,
presence of organic matter in soil has a
close relationship with soil pH. Soil richer
in organic matter is acidic in nature as a
result of degradation of various substances
that produces various acids in soil.
Availability of the nutrients depends on the
pH of soil.

(iii) Biological properties of Soil
Soil is not a dead mass but an abode of
millions of organisms. It is the most
abundant and diverse ecosystem on the
earth. Soil organisms include both plants
and animal forms ranging from
microscopic Viruses to Earthworms, to
large burrowing animals such as rats,
gophers (ground squirrels). Major
microbial groups in soil are bacteria, fungi,
algae and protozoa. These feed on plant
residues burrow the soil and help in aeration
and percolation of water.

Soil microbes also have an influence
in controlling the quantities and effects of
various chemical elements found in soil.
Most notable are the cycles of Carbon,
Nitrogen, Sulphur and Phosphorus, all of
which are elements important in promoting
fertility. Soil microbes convert organic
forms of elements to their inorganic forms
and liberate Carbon dioxide, Ammonium,
Sulphate, Phosphates and inorganic forms
of other elements. This process is known
as ‘Mineralization’.
This is the basis of nutrient cycles in
all major ecosystems of the world. Besides
their role in controlling the rates of
production of inorganic forms from various
organic forms, soil microbes, particularly,
soil bacteria also control the forms of ions
in which these nutrients occur. We shall
study this in detail in the chapter
‘Biogeochemical cycles’.
Soil Pollution

Thus, we can conclude that physical, chemical and biological properties of soils affect
many processes in the soil that make it suitable for cultivation and other purposes.

Soil Fertility
How can you say the soil is a fertile one. Discuss with your classmate and write your
opinion.
Fertility of soil depends on the properties of soil and is defined by its capacity to hold
water and nutrients and supply them to plants when they need them, independent of direct
application of nutrients. Transfer of nutrients from the soil’s organic matter to the mineral
stage strongly depends on the soil organisms’ activity and diversity. Soil organisms also
contribute to buildup soil organic matter, including Humus, the soil’s most important nutrient
reservoir.

When nutrients are bound in biological
or organic form, they are neither lost nor
bound to soil particles but they are
unavailable to the plants. Therefore, soil
fertility can be described in terms of soil
organic matter, good living conditions for
soil organisms and growing conditions for
the roots, the availability of nutrients, water
holding capacity and its biological activity
of the soil.
It is interesting to know that a major
part of the soil microbial biomass is
composed of fungi. Important
representatives of the soil fungi, the
mycorrhizae, grow in symbiosis with about
90% of all plant roots. The plant roots
Free distribution by T.S. Government 2020-21

provide sugar for the growth of Mycorrhiza.
In reverse, the fungus explores the soil and
brings back water as well nutrients such as
Phosphate, Zinc and Copper that are not
easily available to plants. Mycorrhizae
enlarge the rooting zone of plants and enter
small soil pores, where plant roots cannot
access. Soil structure and Mycorrhizal
action help to absorb nutrients from the soil
and deposit it into soil organic matter thus
stabilizing soil structure.
In addition to the above, factors the soil
pH, i.e. the acidity or alkalinity, is highly
relevant to the availability of nutrients in
the soil.

Proper soil fertility management is
very important for successful crop
production and farming. Organic farmers
regulate soil fertility by protecting the soil
and feeding it organic material, thus
ensuring quality yield. When the soil is
fertile in the organic sense, it can produce
good crop yields for several years (You
learned about organic farming in the
chapter 'Challenges in improving
agriculture').

Soil pollution

''The Earth, the Air, the Land and
the Water are not an inheritance from
our forefathers but on loan from our
children. So we have to handover to
them atleast as it was handed over to
us.''
- Mahatma Gandhi.

As we discussed above, soil serves as
the interface between Earth, Air and Water;

152

fulfilling a variety of complex,
interdependent functions essential to life.
Yet human activities alter its ability to
perform its job. As compared to the other
resources, it has taken a long time to
become aware of the wealth, complexity,
usefulness and fragility of the Soil. When
the quality of Air and Water deteriorates,
the threat to public health is felt
immediately. But as long as we can walk
on the earth under our feet, where’s the
danger?
The impacts of various human
activities for development and welfare are
invisible and land pollution is a good
example of that. We can’t easily see the
poisons that seep from underground
Mines, the Garbage we have dumped into
landfills or from Industrialization,
Agriculture and other mismanagement by
human being. Land pollution, in short, is a
much bigger and more subtle problem than
it might appear. How does it occur? And
what can we do about it? These are the
questions to think about. But first let us

There are many ways by which land
pollution can occur. Some soils are
commonly used as dumps for household
and industrial wastes. In many intensively
farmed areas, leaching of nutrients from
manure or inorganic fertilizers and
effluents from processing plants may lead
to high level of nitrate and other chemicals
in ground water. Due to atmospheric
deposition (air pollution) soil gets
contaminated significantly. soil pollution
can be classified into the following
categories based on sources:

pesticides, lead and other heavy metals. The
intensity of pollution correlates with the
degree of industrialization and intensities
of chemical usage.

Pollution due to urban activities

Soil pollution is caused by the
presence of man-made chemicals or other
alteration in the natural soil environment.
This type of contamination typically arises
from the rupture of underground storage
links, application of pesticides, and
percolation of contaminated surface water
to subsurface strata, oil and fuel dumping,
leaching of wastes from landfills or direct
discharge of industrial wastes to the soil.
The most common chemicals involved are

Indiscriminate use of Fertilizers
Soil nutrients are important for plant
growth and development. Plants obtain
Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen from air and
water. But other necessary nutrients like
Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium,
Calcium, Magnesium, Sulphur etc., must be
obtained from the soil. Farmers generally
use fertilizers to correct soil deficiencies.

Fertilizers contaminate the soil with
impurities, which come from the raw
materials used for their manufacture.
Mixed fertilizers often contain Nitrogen as
Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), Phosphorus
as P 2O 5 , and potassium as K 2 O. For
instance, As, Pb and Cd present in traces in

causing eggshells to be thin and fragile. As
a result, large birds of prey such as the
Brown Pelican, Ospreys, Falcons and
Eagles became endangered. DDT is now
banned in most of the Western countries.
Ironically, many of them including USA
still produce DDT for export to other
developing nations whose needs outweigh
the problems caused by it.
Besides DDT, other most important
pesticides are BHC (Benzene Hexa
Chloride), Chlorinated di Hydro Carbons,
Organo Phosphates, Aldrin, Malathion,
Dieldrin, Furodan, etc. The remnants of
such pesticides used on pests may get
absorbed by the soil particles, which then
contaminate crops grown in that soil. The
consumption of such crops causes the
pesticide remnants to enter human
biological systems affecting them
adversely.
Pesticides not only have toxic effect
on human and animals but also decrease the
fertility of the soil. Some of the pesticides
are quite stable and their bio- degradation
may take weeks and even months.

rock phosphate mineral get transferred to
super phosphate fertilizer. Since the metals
are not degradable, their accumulation in
the soil above their toxic levels due to
excessive use of phosphate fertilizers
becomes an indestructible poison for crops.
Over usage of NPK fertilizers reduce
quantity of vegetables and crops grown on
soil over the years. It also reduces the
protein content of Wheat, Maize, Pulses
etc., grown on that soil. The Carbohydrate
quality of such crops also gets degraded.
Excess Potassium content in soil
decreases Vitamin C and Carotene content
in vegetables and fruits. The vegetables and
fruits grown on over fertilized soil are
more prone to attacks by insects and
diseases.

Indiscriminate use of pesticides,

SC

We depend on plants for various
purposes, but they are under constant attack
from insects, fungi, bacteria, viruses,
rodents and other animals, and must
compete with weeds for nutrients. To kill
unwanted populations living in or on their
crops, farmers use pesticides.
The first widespread use of insecticide
began at the end of World War II that
included DDT (Dichloro Diphenyl
Trichloroethane) and Gammaxene. Insects
soon became resistant to DDT as the
chemical did not decompose readily, it
persisted in the environment.
Since DDT is soluble in fat rather than
water, it biomagnified up in the food chain
and disrupted calcium metabolism in birds,
156

Biomagnification
The nutrients necessary for plant growth
(e.g., Nitrogen and Phosphorus) are found
at very low concentrations in most natural
waters. In order to obtain sufficient
quantities for growth, Phytoplankton must
collect these chemical elements from a
relatively large volume of water.
In the process of collecting nutrients,
phytoplankton also collects certain humanmade chemicals, such as some persistent
pesticides. These may be present in the

cannot be measured even with very
sensitive instruments. The chemicals,
however, biologically accumulate
(bioaccumulation) in the organism and
become concentrated at levels that are
much higher in the living cells than in the
open water. This is especially true for
persistent chemicals or substances that do
not break down readily in the environment
like DDT and BHCs that are stored in fatty
tissues.
The small fish and zooplankton eat vast
quantities of phytoplankton. In doing so, any
toxic chemicals accumulated by the
phytoplankton are further concentrated in
the bodies of the animals that eat them. This
is repeated at each step in the food chain.
This process of increasing concentration
through the food chain is known as
biomagnification.

Dumping of solid wastes

The overflowing and the stench rising

Since the beginning, mankind has been
generating waste, from the bones and other
parts of animals they slaughter for their
food or the wood they cut to make their
carts. With the progress of Civilization, the
waste generated became a more complex
issue. At the end of the 19th century
because of the Industrial Revolution there
is a rise of the world of consumers. Not
only did the air get more and more polluted,
but also the Earth polluted with the
generation of non-biodegradable solid

urbanization are largely responsible for the

agricultural waste is recycled and mining

We have to pay attention to hazardous
solid waste like oils, battery metals, heavy
metals from smelting industries and
organic solvents.These can in the long run,
get deposited to the soils of the surrounding
area and pollute them by altering their
chemical and biological properties. They
also contaminate drinking water aquifer
sources. More than 90% of hazardous waste
is produced by chemical, petroleum and

Solid waste means any garbage, trash,
waste tyres, sludge from a waste treatment
plant, water supply treatment plant and
other discarded materials, including solid,
liquid, semisolid or gaseous materials
arises from human and animal activities. In
other words, solid waste may be defined as
the organic and inorganic waste produced
by various activities of the society which
have lost their value to the first user.
Solid waste, on the basis of its sources
of origin can be classified as:
1. Municipal Solid Waste: It consists
of household waste; construction
and demolition debris, sanitation
residue.
2. Hazardous Solid Waste: Industrial
and hospital waste is considered to
be hazardous and poisonous waste as
they contain toxic substances.
3. Infectious Solid Waste: Biomedical
or hospital waste generated during
diagnosis treatment etc. which
include sharp instruments, chemical
wastes, discarded medicines and
human excreta etc.
In general, solid waste includes
garbage, domestic refuse and discarded
solid materials such as those from
commercial, industrial and agricultural
operations. They contain increasing
amounts of paper, cardboards, plastics,
glass, old construction material, packaging
material and toxic or otherwise hazardous
substances. Since a significant amount of
urban solid waste tends to be paper and food

Deforestation
Soil Erosion occurs when the
weathered soil particles are dislodged and
carried away by wind or water.
Deforestation, agricultural land
development, temperature extremes,
precipitation including acid rain, and human
activities contribute to this erosion.
Humans speed up this process by
construction, mining, cutting of timber,
over cropping and overgrazing. It results in
floods and soil erosion.
Forests and grasslands are an excellent
binding material that keeps the soil intact

remaining. That might not sound a problem
where there’s plenty of land in rural areas,
but it’s certainly a concern where productive
agricultural land is concerned, especially
as the world’s population continues to
increase.
The biggest problem comes when
contaminated land is returned to use, either
for building or for agriculture. Houses
might be built on brown field (former
industrial land), the sites that haven’t been
cleaned up properly, putting future owners
and their families at risk. Or people might
get their water from rivers supplied by
groundwater contaminated by landfill sites,
mine workings, or otherwise polluted land
some distance away.
Illnesses such as Cancer develop over
years or decades for a variety of reasons
and it’s extremely difficult to prove that
they’ve been caused by something like
local environmental pollution, especially
when people move homes during their
lifetime. No-one knows how much land is
contaminated, how contamination varies
from one place to another, or how land
contaminants react with one another once
they enter water resources and become
water pollution. So the scale of the problem
and its ultimate effects are impossible to
determine.
However, we do know what effect
individual pollutants have. We know, for
example, that Lead is a toxic heavy metal
that has all kinds of unpleasant effects on
human health; it’s been implicated in
developmental deficits (such as reductions
in intelligence) in children. We know that

Many dangerous chemicals like
Cadmium, Chromium, Lead, Arsenic,
Selenium products are likely to be
deposited in underground soil. Similarly
underground soil polluted by sanitary
wastes generates many harmful chemicals.
These can damage the normal activities and
ecological balance in the underground soil.

Luckily, when right atmospheric
conditions arrive, air and water pollutions
can get reduced at great extent. But in case
of land pollution unless some removes the
pollutants, soil can't be restored. Land
that’s polluted stays polluted; land that’s
urbanized almost invariably stays urbanized.
As we know, plastics take hundreds of
years to degrade while radiation can
contaminate land for ten times longer. That
means landfill sites and radioactive waste
dumps remain that way pretty much
indefinitely.
The simplest effect of land pollution
is that it takes land out of circulation. The

Long term effects of soil pollution
on the Environment
When it comes to the environment
itself, the toll of contaminated soil is even
more dire. Soil that has been contaminated
should no longer be used to grow food
crops, because the chemicals can leach
into the food and harm people who eat it.
If contaminated soil is used to grow
food crops, the land will usually produce
lower yields than it would if it were not
contaminated. This, in turn, can cause even
more harm because lack of plants on the
soil will cause more erosion, spreading the
contaminants onto land that might not have
been tainted before.
In addition, the pollutants will change
the makeup of the soil and the types of
microorganisms that live in it. If certain
organisms die off in the area, the larger
predator animals will also have to move
away or die because they’ve lost their prey.
Thus it’s possible for soil pollution to
change whole ecosystems.

Control of soil pollution
The following steps have been
suggested to control soil pollution. To help
prevent soil pollution, we can limit
construction in sensitive area. In general
we would need less fertilizer and fewer
pesticides if we could all adopt the four
(4Rs) "R": Reduce, Reuse, Recover and
Recycle. This would give us less solid
waste.
161

Reducing chemical fertilizers and
pesticide use

Materials such as glass containers,
plastic bags, paper, cloth etc. can be reused
at domestic levels rather than being
disposed.

Thus, Proper methods should be
adopted for management of solid waste
disposal. Solid waste management involves
activities including collection, transfer and
transport to suitable sites, and safe disposal
of wastes by methods which are
environmentally compatible.
Industrial wastes can be treated
physically, chemically and biologically
until they are less hazardous. Acidic and
alkaline wastes should be first neutralized;
the insoluble material if biodegradable

Applying bio-fertilizers and manures
can reduce chemical fertilizer and pesticide
use. Biological methods of pest control can
also reduce the use of pesticides and
thereby minimize soil pollution.

This is a reasonable solution for
reducing soil pollution. Materials such as
paper, some kinds of plastics and glass can
be recycled. This decreases the volume of
refuse and helps in the conservation of
natural resources. For example, recycling
of one ton of paper can save 17 trees.

Control of land loss and soil erosion
can be attempted through restoring forests
and grass cover. Crop rotation or mixed
cropping can improve the fertility of the
land.

Solid waste management

The solid wastes which are accumulated
on the soil will pose a great problem to us.
Throwing the wastes in dump yards is not
the solution to the problem. For throwing
wastes we need enormous land area.
The average per capita solid wastes
produced per day is 364 grams. To dispose
all the wastes we need an area equal to the
size of Hyderabad city(590 sq km) by the

should be allowed to degrade under
controlled conditions before being
disposed.
As a last resort, new areas for storage
of hazardous waste should be investigated
such as deep well injection and more
secure landfills. Burying the waste in
locations situated away from residential
areas is the simplest and most widely used
technique of solid waste management.

organic contaminants. With metal
contamination the usual challenge is to
accumulate the metal into harvestable plant
parts, which must then be disposed off in a
hazardous waste landfill before or after
incineration to reduce the plant to ash. Two
exceptions are mercury and selenium,
which can be released as volatile elements
directly from plants to atmosphere.

Bioremediation

Natural land pollution

Bioremediation means to use a
biological remedy to abate or clean up
contamination. This makes it different from
remedies where contaminated soil or water
is removed for chemical treatment or
decontamination, incineration, or burial in
a landfill. Microbes are often used to
remedy environmental problems found in
soil, water, and sediments. Plants have also
been used to assist bioremediation
processes. This is called phytoremediation.
Biological processes have been used for
some inorganic materials, like metals, to

earth quakes, landslides, hurricanes and
floods. All cause hard to clean mass, which
is expensive to clean, and may sometimes

consideration before selecting the dumping
sites. Incineration of other wastes is
expensive and leaves a huge residue and
adds to air pollution.
The Pyrolysis is a process of
combustion in the absence of oxygen or the
material burnt under controlled atmosphere
of oxygen. It is an alternative to
incineration. The gas and liquid thus
obtained can be used as fuels. Pyrolysis of
carbonaceous wastes like firewood,
coconut, palm waste, corn combs, cashew
shell, rice husk paddy straw and saw dust,
yields charcoal along with products like tar,
methyl alcohol, acetic acid, acetone and a
fuel gas, may reduce soil pollution.
Anaerobic/aerobic decomposition of
biodegradable municipal and domestic
waste is also being done and gives organic
manure. Cow dung which releases methane
into the atmosphere, should be processed
further in ‘gobar gas plants’ to produce
‘gobar gas’ and good manure.

Plant trees

We all know that the roots of trees
firmly hold on to the soil. As trees grow
tall, they also keep rooting deeper into the
soil. As the roots of the trees spread deep
into the layers of soil, they contribute to
the prevention of soil erosion. Soil that is
under a vegetative cover has hardly any
chance of getting eroded as the vegetative
cover acts as a wind barrier as well.

Terraces

Terracing is one of the very good
methods of soil conservation. A terrace is
a leveled section of a hilly cultivated area.
Owing to its unique structure, it prevents
the rapid surface runoff of water. Terracing
gives the landmass a stepped appearance
thus slowing the easy washing down of the
soil. Dry stonewalling is a method used to
create terraces in which stone structures
are created without using mortar for
binding.

No-till farming
When soil is prepared for farming by
ploughing it, the process is known as tilling.
164

No-till farming is a way of growing crops
without disturbing it through tillage. The
process of tilling is beneficial in mixing
fertilizers in the soil, shaping it into rows
and preparing a surface for sowing. But the
tilling activity can lead to compaction of
soil, loss of organic matter in soil and the
death of the organisms in soil. No-till
farming is a way to prevent the soil from
being affected by these adversities.

conservation is relatively less talked about
as compared to the conservation of water
and other natural resources. The almostomnipresent soil is mostly taken for
granted. Its omnipresence is ironically the
reason behind us, human beings, taking it
for a ride. We rarely even think of it as a
natural resource that needs to be conserved,
a part of the natural wealth that needs to be
preserved. There are several ways possible
for soil conservation that can be achieved
through agricultural practices and measures
that can be taken at home.

Contour ploughing

This practice of farming across the
slopes takes into account the slope gradient
and the elevation of soil across the slope.
It is the method of ploughing across the
contour lines of a slope. This method helps
in slowing the water runoff and prevents the
soil from being washed away along the
slope. Contour ploughing also helps in the
percolation of water into the soil.

Crop rotation

Some pathogens tend to build up in soil
if the same crops are cultivated
consecutively. Continuous cultivation of
the same crop also leads to an imbalance
in the fertility demands of the soil. To
prevent these adverse effects from taking
place, crop rotation is practiced. It is a
method of growing a series of dissimilar
crops in an area sequentially. Crop rotation
also helps in the improvement of soil
structure and fertility.

Soil pH
The contamination of soil by addition
of acidic or basic pollutants and acid rains
has an adverse effect on the pH of soil. Soil
pH is one of the determinants of the
availability of nutrients in soil. The uptake
Soil Pollution

of nutrients in plants is also governed to a
certain extent, by the soil pH. The
maintenance of the most suitable value of
pH, is thus, essential for the conservation
of soil fertility.

Watering the soil

The salinity of soil that is caused by
the excessive accumulation of salts has a
negative effect on the metabolism of the
crops in soil. Salinity of soil is detrimental
to the vegetative life in the soil. The death

Soil formation is a long and complex process that takes from 100 to 10,000 years
and driven by many factors including climate, topography, living organisms and
types of parent material.
Soil properties are classified into three groups, i.e., Physical, chemical and
biological properties of the soil.
Soil fertility is closely associated with soil properties and it is defined as its capacity
to hold water and nutrients and supply them to plants when they need them,
independent of direct application of nutrients.
Soil or land pollution can be defined as Soil pollution is defined as the build-up in
soils of persistent toxic compounds, chemicals, salts, radioactive materials, or
disease causing agents, which have adverse effects on plant growth and animal health.
Wastes generated from various sources are categorized into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable waste.
Biodegradable material is any organic material that can be broken down by
microorganisms into simpler more stable compounds. Most organic wastes likewood, paper, are biodegradable.
Materials that cannot be degraded by microbial action are said to be nonbiodegradable materials.
Land pollution is broadly caused by agricultural practices, Industrial wastes and
urban activities.
Biomagnification is the sequence of processes in an ecosystem by which higher
concentrations of a particular chemical, such as the pesticide DDT, are reached in
organisms higher up the food chain, generally through a series of prey-predator
relationships.
Soil erosion is a natural process. It became a problem due to various human activities
causing it to occur much faster than under natural conditions.
Deforestation, agriculture development, temperature extremes, precipitation
including acid rain and human activities contributed to soil pollution.
Soil pollution leads to an imbalance in ecosystem and is closely associated with air
and water pollution. The harmful effects are not seen clearly but reduced crop yield
due to reduced soil fertility and loss of soil and nutrients. Groundwater pollution,
foul smell and public health problems are some of the effects that attract human
being to think of this problem.
There are many ways to control soil pollution which includes, four "R" : Reduce,
Reuse, Recover and Recycle and reforesting, proper solid waste management and
bioremediation.

fact, a major portion of the plastic bags i.e.
approximately 60-80% of the plastic waste
generated in India is collected and

Biogeochemical Cycles

We have learnt about environmental
pollution and ecosystem in the previous
chapter. Living things within an ecosystem
interact with each other and also with their
non-living environment to form an
ecological unit that is largely selfcontained. Sometimes this renewal process
is gradual and gentle. Sometimes it is
violent and destructive. Nevertheless,
ecosystems contain resources within
themselves which can regenerate.
There is usually a physical state,
chemical form, and location in the cycle
in which nature stores the bulk of the
various chemical elements. Pollution
occurs when the cycle is sufficiently
disturbed either by accumulation of any
element at some point in the cycle in
inappropriate physical state or chemical
form or amount disrupting environmental
balance.
Thus, this is important to understand
how nature is maintaining itself and what
are the impacts of human activities on this
self contained ecological unit. To
understand these, we would need to know
atleast some of the cycles of nature in
which nutrients are exchanged and passed
170

on from one level to the other as well as
from one state to the other. The cycles that
involve the flow of nutrients on earth
(elements essential for the living cell) from
environment to organisms and back through
certain pathways are known as
biogeochemical cycles.

Biogeochemical cycles

A constant interaction, between the
biotic and abiotic components of the
biosphere, makes it a dynamic, but stable
system. These interactions consist of
transfer of matter and energy between the
different components of the biosphere.
Bio-geo-chemical pathways determine the
path of transfer of matter on earth. Let us
look at some of the major biogeochemical
cycles.
Biogeochemical cycles as we may see
from the name itself includes both
biological, geological and chemical or
physicochemical pathways. This means the
reservoir or pool of nutrients on earth may
contain some chemicals of biological
origin while others may be purely inorganic
in nature also may be geochemical
(obtained from rocks and soil) in origin.

as groundwater. Only about 0.009% of
water on earth is in the rivers and lakes.
Rest is present in the bodies of living
organisms, as soil moisture, as humidity of
atmosphere etc.
Water is the most essential, abundant
substance in living things. The human body
for example, is composed of about 70%
water (remember all living organisms
together constitute only 0.005% of water
on earth). Water participates in many
biochemical mechanisms, including
photosynthesis, digestion and cellular
respiration. It is also the habitat for many
species of plants, animals and
microorganisms, and it participates in the
cycling of the materials used by living
things. So, it is important that
we protect our water resources.
Water evaporates from the
water bodies in the form of
water vapour and the subsequent
condensation of this water
vapour leads to rain.

Water though not considered as a biogeo-chemical cycle by most ecologists
actually is the precursor of the major
elements Hydrogen and Oxygen as some
living organisms use them for making the
basic food molecules for several
organisms in nature.
Water is also a universal solvent and
essential for various reactions to take place
within a living cell. Thus we shall also take

Rains’.

The Nitrogen cycle
Nitrogen is the most abundant element
in the atmosphere and, a building block of
proteins and nucleic acids. The Nitrogen
cycle is a complex biogeochemical cycle
in which Nitrogen is converted from its
inert atmospheric molecular form (N2)
into a form that is useful in biological
processes.
The element Nitrogen is constantly
moving in a giant circle from the air,
through the soil, into the bodies of plants
and animals, and eventually back to the air
by the process of Nitrogen cycle. All living
things need nitrogen mainly for growth,
repair and development (Nitrogen being
essential for protein formation).
Even though the Earth’s atmosphere is
made up of 78% nitrogen, plants and
animals cannot use it in this form. The
atmospheric nitrogen is thus converted into
certain compounds which plants may take
up from the soil by some biochemical
process by certain bacteria like Rhizobium,
Nitrosomonas etc. and physicochemical
processes by lightning. Animals get the
required amount of nitrogen from plants
either directly (herbivores) or indirectly
(carnivores).
The nitrogen cycle contains several

oceans via several routes like rivers,
ground water channels etc is known as
the Water-cycle.
This cycle is not as straight-forward
and simple as this statement seems to imply.
All the water that falls on the land does not
immediately flow back into the sea. Some
of it sinks into the soil and becomes part
of the underground reservoir of freshwater. Some of this underground water
finds its way to the surface through springs
or we bring it to the surface for our use
through wells or tube wells.
Water is also used by terrestrial animals
and plants for various life-processes. Water
provides hydrogen and oxygen that form
integral part of basic organic compounds
of life.
Let us look at another aspect of what
happens to water during the water-cycle. As
you know, water is capable of dissolving a
large number of substances. Thus, it cleans
the environment as it rains and water
soluble pollutants are transported to
different water bodies like lakes and
Oceans.
This dilutes the intensity of pollutants.
Also, as water flows through or over rocks
containing soluble minerals, some of them
get dissolved in the water. Thus rivers carry
many nutrients from the land to the Sea,
and some of these are used by the marine
organisms and rest of these get deposited
which takes a longer time to cycle
completely through the system.
On the other hand, it creates troubles
as well. Dissolution of some harmful
substances, like gases like SO2 and oxides

the soil (especially in waterlogged soils).

Most of the atmospheric nitrogen is ‘fixed’
through biological processes. A number of
bacteria and blue green algae are known to
be able to fix atmospheric nitrogen into
compounds in their own body. These may
be symbiotic (Rhizobium) or freeliving
(Clostridium) respectively. These
organisms convert atmospheric nitrogen
into the organic nitrogen. This nitrogen,
now present in the soil as compounds

plants like pea, beans etc there is a
symbiotic relationship of the nitrogen

nitrogenous compounds are added to the
soil after a leguminous crop is grown.

Unfortunately, humans are interfering

artificially produced nitrates as agricultural
fertilizers that are often washed into water

sewage into water bodies. Before these
nitrates can be converted into atmospheric
nitrogen, they are often carried off by rain

Ammonification also occurs when

ammonia which is then available for

Carbon is found in various forms on the
Earth. It occurs in the elemental form as
say Soot, Diamond and Graphite. In the
combined state, it is found as gases, Carbon
dioxide and Carbon monoxide in the
atmosphere, as carbonate and hydrogen
carbonate salts in various minerals, while
all life-forms are composed of carbon
containing molecules like Proteins,
Carbohydrates, Fats, Nucleic acids and
Vitamins. The endoskeletons and
exoskeletons of various animals are also
formed from carbonate salts.

Carbon dioxide is also responsible for
maintaining the Earth as a Green house with
temperature conditions suitable for life.
Thus, Carbon exists in the biosphere as the
central element of life. Carbon Dioxide
(CO2), now makes up about 0.04% by
volume of air.
Have you ever thought how this level
of Carbon is being maintained in the
nature?
Carbon is incorporated into life
through various processes. The main
reservoirs of carbon are sedimentary rocks,
fossilized organic carbon including the
fossil fuels, the oceans, and the biosphere.

Fig-4 : Carbon cycle

Photosynthesis

The first step in the biological
carbon cycle is the conversion of
inorganic atmospheric carbon into a
biological form. This ‘fixing’ of
carbon in biological form takes place
within plants and other organisms known as producers by a process
called photosynthesis, in which
energy from sunlight is converted into
chemical form.
In photosynthesis, light energy
helps to combine carbon dioxide and
water to create Glucose (C6H12O6).
In oceans, photosynthesis is carried
out by microscopic aquatic plants
called
phytoplankton.
The
carbohydrates then become the
source of chemical energy to cells in
all plants and animals. In plants, some

down for energy and CO2 gas and other
byproducts are emitted. Combustion of
fossil fuels and other carbon containing
substances, forest fires, volcanic emissions
etc. also return carbondioxide to the
atmospheric reservoir.
The other source of CO2 to return into
atmospheric reservoir is the death of plants.
As the microorganisms consume the plant
matter, they release some of the plant’s
carbon into the atmosphere in the form of
CO2, although some is destined for long
term storage in trunks and branches of trees
and in the bodies of plant-eating animals
or carnivorous animals that eat plant-eating
animals.
Animals return more of the carbon to
the atmosphere as CO2 through respiration
as we already know, although some will be
stored within their bodies until they die and
decompose in the soil. Carbon in the form
of several compounds will remain stored
in the soil as organic matter for example
the fossil fuels that we use.

carbon remains as simple glucose for
short-term energy use, while some are
converted to large complex molecules
such as starch for long term energy storage.

The movement of carbondioxide takes
place from the atmospheric reservoir of
carbon dioxide directly as such to
producers mainly the green plants, to
consumers and from both of these groups
to the microbial decomposer organisms.
Fossil fuels, carbonate rocks and
carbondioxide dissolved in the oceans are
major additional reservoirs of carbon.
The first two of these additional
reservoir are not directly available to plants
for fixation. CO2 from these resources
becomes available when either fossil fuels
are burnt or insoluble carbonates are
converted to soluble bicarbonates. The
return of carbondioxide to the atmospheric
reservoir is accomplished in many ways.
Mainly through respiratory processes
wherein food molecules are broken

Carbon buried under the ocean floor
might take millions of years to return to

the Earth’s history, the emission of
CO2 (and many other gases) from deep

escaping. It is warm inside. In the same way
that the glass traps heat in a greenhouse,
some gases present in the atmosphere such
as Carbon dioxide, Carbon monoxide,
Methane and Water vapour trap heat from
radiating back to the space. The natural
greenhouse gases act like a big blanket
around the earth, keeping it warm and
making life possible without which
temperatures would have fallen to sub zero
values.This phenomenon of naturally
warming up is called ‘‘Greenhouse effect”.

Human beings tap into the geological
carbon cycle by extracting oil and coal,
which are both hydrocarbons(formed of
carbon and hydrogen), for use
in automobiles and power plants. A by
product of combustion of these
hydrocarbons is CO2 and CO gases. Since
the Industrial Revolution began, carbon
dioxide levels in the atmosphere have
increased measurably, mostly as a result of
human use of fossil fuels.
Humans have also altered the biological
carbon cycle, increasing atmospheric
CO2 levels, through forest clearing and
land use. Trees store large amounts of
carbon; when they die and decompose,
much of this stored carbon is released as
CO2.
However, when humans clear large
places of forest, primarily through the use
of fire, the levels of atmospheric carbon
is affected in two ways. First, during
combustion, stored carbon is released
directly into the air as CO2, and second, the
clearing of land takes away a key
mechanism for removing excess carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere (via
photosynthesis).
Since carbon dioxide is a
primary Green house gas, the increase in
atmospheric CO2 due to human activities
has resulted in an enhanced Green house
effect resulting in higher global
temperatures.

result more heat gets trapped. This causes

Oxygen is vital for life in many ways.
Respiration utilizes oxygen releasing
carbon dioxide to atmospheric pool
maintaining a balance in nature. Dissolved
oxygen supports aquatic life. Oxygen
dissolves in water on the basis of different
conditions. High temperatures do not
support the process while a lot of
turbulence in water usually at the surface
helps greater amount of oxygen to dissolve.
Oxygen is needed for the
decomposition of organic waste. Wastes
from living organisms are “biodegradable”
because there are aerobic bacteria that
convert organic waste materials into stable
inorganic materials. If enough oxygen is not
available for these bacteria, for example,
because of enormous quantities of wastes,
they die and anaerobic bacteria that do not
need oxygen take over. These bacteria
change waste material into H2S and other
poisonous and foul-smelling substances.

Most commercial airline traffic occurs in
the lower part of the Stratosphere. most
atmospheric ozone is concentrated in a
layer in the stratosphere, about 15-30
kilometers above the Earth’s surface.
Ozone (O3) is a molecule containing three
Oxygen atoms. It is blue in colour and has
a strong odour.
Normal oxygen, which we breathe, has
two oxygen atoms and is colourless and
odourless. Ozone is much less common
than normal oxygen. Out of each 10 million
air molecules, about 2 million are normal
Oxygen, but only 3 out of 10 millions are
Ozone.
However, even the small amount of
ozone plays a key role in the atmosphere.
The ozone layer absorbs a portion of the
radiation from the sun, preventing it from
reaching the planet’s surface.
Most important of all it absorbs the
portion of ultraviolet light which causes
many harmful effects, including various
types of skin cancer and harm to some
crops, certain materials, and some forms
of marine life.
At any given time, Ozone molecules
constantly get formed and destroyed in the
stratosphere. The total amount, however,
remains relatively constant.
Collect the information about effects
of Ozone from your school library/Inernet

of ozone-depleting substances to the

examples are the

Most of these gases accumulate in the
lower atmosphere because they are
unreactive and do not dissolve readily in
rain or snow. Natural air motions transport
these accumulated gases to the
Stratosphere, where they are converted to
more reactive gases. Some of these gases
then participate in reactions that destroy
Ozone. The Ozone hole is not really a hole,

countries. The original agreement was to control and phase out the production and supply
of Ozone depleting chemicals, specifically CFCs (Chloro Fluoro Carbons) and their

meeting agreed to bring forward the phase out of Halons to 1994, and CFCs and other

What we have learnt?

Representations of Biological, Geological and Chemical processes that involve the
movement of an element or compound about the surface of the earth are collectively
known as ‘Biogeochemical Cycles’.
Living things within an Ecosystem interact with each other and also with their nonliving environment to form an ecological unit that is largely self-contained.
Ecosystems contain within themselves the resources to regenerate themselves and there
is usually a physical state, chemical form and location in the cycle in which nature
stores the bulk of various chemical elements.
Biogeochemical cycles are complex in nature and consist of pools of several elements
(like Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Calcium, Potassium, Sodium, Iron etc)
essential for life that circulate through living systems and are replenished in the pool.
They include a variety of biological, geological and chemical processes.
Water, Oxygen, Carbon and Nitrogen are the key elements for life and are continuously
recycled in the nature.
Denitrification is the conversion, principally by bacteria, of compounds of Nitrogen in
soil and aquatic systems to the gases, Nitrogen (N2) and Nitrous oxide (N2O) and eventual
release of these into the atmosphere.
